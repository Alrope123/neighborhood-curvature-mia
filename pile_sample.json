If you pay off a loan or otherwise improve your credit score, you should shop around for car insurance as your premium should change. Just another reason to keep your score up!\nYou\u2019ll notice that none of that liability coverage pays for your car or injuries, nor for any injuries your passengers sustain if you cause a wreck. This is why many people \u2014 particularly those whose car isn\u2019t yet paid off \u2014 want \u201cfull coverage\u201d car insurance. This isn\u2019t actually a type of coverage, but instead typically refers to policies that include liability coverage, plus comprehensive and collision coverages.\n\nAuto Insurance is required by law for drivers in most states. Drivers who own a car and drive it often should definitely have auto insurance to cover the risk of damages to their car and personal injury and the liability of harm to other people and property. Otherwise, repairs and medical costs, particularly when you\u2019re liable for an accident, can be very expensive.\n\nLiability auto insurance protects you from that worst case scenario by providing a cushion between your assets and the amount you\u2019re on the hook for. For this reason, choosing the right auto liability limits is the most important part of your car insurance quote comparison. NerdWallet typically recommends having at least as much liability coverage as your net worth.\nThe best car insurance companies have a few things in common: They have straightforward shopping experiences, take good care of policyholders after a crash and treat their customers with respect and courtesy. That means only insurers with high customer satisfaction scores and relatively few complaints to insurance commissioners make it to the top of our list of the best auto insurance companies.\nThe key difference in collision vs. comprehensive coverage is that, to a certain extent, the element of the car driver's control. As we have stated before, collision insurance will typically cover events within a motorist's control, or when another vehicle collides with your car. Comprehensive coverage generally falls under \"acts of God or nature,\" that are typically out of your control when driving. These can include such events as a spooked deer, a heavy hailstorm, or a carjacking.\nThe life insurance market has shrunk by around 4% over the last ten years. Interestingly, the market shrunk after the recession then grew about 51% between 2010 and 2015, though it has since begun to drop in size again. In 2017, life insurance premiums exceeded the amount spent in four of the past five years, but still came short of levels seen in 2008 and 2015. Check out our graph below to see how the market has fluctuated in the last decade. All numbers in billions.\nKnow when to cut coverage. Don\u2019t strip away coverage just for the sake of cheaper insurance. You\u2019ll need full coverage car insurance to satisfy the terms of an auto loan, and you\u2019ll want it as long as your car would be a financial burden to replace. But for older cars, you can drop comprehensive and collision coverage, which only pay out up to your car\u2019s current value, minus the deductible.\nThe best companies will also have several supplemental coverage options, or endorsements, that you can add to your homeowners policy. Endorsements can vary, as some provide higher coverage limits for certain types of personal property like jewelry or fine furs; or they can provide supplemental coverage for risks \u2014 like water backups, floods, or earthquakes \u2014 not covered by home insurance.\nIf you live in an area with unusual state regulations or heightened risk of weather-related claims, shopping car insurance options will be vital. Not every car insurance company offers policies in every state, which can make pricing less competitive. If you live in storm-prone states like Louisiana or Florida, you might find it harder to get a competitive rate.\n\nIf you have very poor credit, the cheapest car insurance company is Nationwide. Here, your premium will be more than $435 less than the group average. Compared to the highest credit level, drivers with bad credit pay nearly $1,450 more per year for auto insurance. If you pay off a loan or otherwise improve your credit score, you should shop around for car insurance as your premium should change. Just another reason to keep your score up!\n\nTo calculate the added cost in purchasing comprehensive and/or collision coverage we looked at annual insurance quotes for a 30 year old male from New York across four different insurance companies, and the ten best-selling vehicles in the US. We look at the range of rates you could pay from basic liability to policy plans with comprehensive and collision coverage. Collision typically costs more than comprehensive, although some companies require you to carry both rather than just one. Comparing quotes across at least three companies can get you lower car insurance rates.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Pile-CC"}}, "Github": {"text": "goog.module('nested.exported.enums');\n\n/** @const */\nexports = {\n  /** @const @enum {string} */\n  A: {\n    A1: 'a1',\n  },\n  // The structure of the AST changes if this extra property is present.\n  B: 0,\n};", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Github"}}, "OpenWebText2": {"text": "This item has been removed from the community because it violates Steam Community & Content Guidelines.

The armature has windings and the field can have either windings or permanent magnets.\nSome applications have a need for constant speed regardless of torque. A general statement about DC motors is that with an increase in torque, speed will drop and current will increase, assuming a constant input voltage. The amount each parameter varies depends on the type of motor. For a motor with the armature and field winding connected in series the drop in speed will be more pronounced than the increase in current. For motors with shunt connected windings or permanent magnet fields the opposite is true, the speed will be more nearly constant while there is a marked increase in current. There will be some drop in speed however, and this amount may be undesirable in critical applications. For this reason, a number of constant speed controls have been devised over the years.\nSpeed regulating systems may be classified as either closed loop or open loop. Closed loop systems derive a signal from the actual speed of the motor with a tachometer, for example, and use the signal in a feedback loop.\nAn open loop system does not measure speed directly but measures some other parameter. In some open loop systems the measured parameter is current.\nA well known example of an open loop motor regulating system includes a resistor in series with the input of the motor. The voltage across the resistor corresponds to motor current and is directed to a control circuit. The resistor voltage influences a control circuit which supplies the input voltage to the motor. A change in resistor voltage indicates a change in torque and indirectly indicates a change in speed. In response to the resistor voltage the control circuit adjusts the voltage to the motor thereby supplying the right amount of power required to maintain a constant speed over variations in torque.\nThe series resistor causes I.sup.2 R power losses particularly when during high torque conditions because current is high. These losses cause heat build-up and a need for a larger power supply capability.\nIt will be seen that a speed regulator according to the present invention does not require a resistor in series with the motor and is thereby more efficient.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "USPTO Backgrounds"}}, "FreeLaw": {"text": "154 F.3d 417\nU.S.v.Chukwuma*\nNO. 97-11093\nUnited States Court of Appeals,Fifth Circuit.\nJuly 29, 1998\nAppeal From:  N.D.Tex. ,No397CR104D\n\n1\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n*\n Fed.R.App.P. 34(a); 5th Cir.R. 34-2\n\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "FreeLaw"}}, "PubMed Central": {"text": "1. Introduction {#sec1}\n===============\n\nHealth care is changing dynamically in the 2010s. The economic recession and problems with recruiting professionals \\[[@B1], [@B2]\\], staff retention \\[[@B3]\\], creating healthy work environments \\[[@B4], [@B5]\\], and a growing demand for customer orientation \\[[@B6]\\] pose challenges for nurse managers\\' work. More expertise in management is needed to respond to these issues.\n\nOne essential area of nurse manager\\'s management skills is the use of different leadership styles \\[[@B7]\\]. Leadership styles can be seen as different combinations of tasks and transaction behaviours that influence people in achieving goals \\[[@B8]\\]. Earlier studies indicate that nurse manager\\'s effective leadership style is affiliated to staff retention \\[[@B5]\\], work unit climate \\[[@B4]\\], nurses\\' job satisfaction \\[[@B9], [@B10]\\], nurses\\' commitment \\[[@B11]\\], and patient satisfaction \\[[@B12]\\].\n\nTransformational leadership style \\[[@B5], [@B6], [@B13], [@B14]\\] and transactional leadership \\[[@B7]\\] help to respond to these issues. Transformational leadership refers to the leader\\'s skills to influence others towards achieving goals by changing the followers\\' beliefs, values, and needs \\[[@B7]\\]. Transactional leadership complements and enhances the effects of transformational leadership outcomes \\[[@B15]\\].\n\nThere are certain skills required from nurse managers so as to be able to use these effective leadership styles. The skills include the ability to create an organization culture that combines high-quality health care and patient/employee safety and highly developed collaborative and team-building skills \\[[@B1]\\]. Nurse managers also need to have the readiness to observe their own behaviour \\[[@B16]\\] and its effects on the work unit; as a result, employees can adjust to a better leadership style. These kinds of skills are related to manager\\'s emotional intelligence (EI).\n\nEI is an ability to lead ourselves and our relationships effectively \\[[@B17]\\]. It has been defined as the ability to observe one\\'s own and others\\' feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to direct one\\'s thinking and actions \\[[@B18]\\]. EI is composed of personal competence and social competence. Self-awareness and self-management are reflections of personal competence, influencing the way the leader manages him/herself. Social awareness and relationship management reflect social competence, which affects how the leader manages relationships with others \\[[@B17]\\].\n\nNurse managers with that skill can easily form relationships with others, read employees\\' feelings and responses accurately, and lead successfully \\[[@B19]--[@B21]\\]. Emotionally intelligent leaders\\' behaviour also stimulates the creativity of their employees \\[[@B22]\\]. Goleman et al. \\[[@B23]\\] have identified visionary, coaching, affiliate, and democratic styles as resonant, and pacesetting and commanding styles as dissonant leadership styles. Most leaders use both resonant and dissonant leadership styles. The leadership styles of Goleman et al. are applied as the basis of this study because earlier studies refer to the significance of these styles, especially that of EI in manager\\'s work. In addition, these leadership styles are one way of aiming to carry out transformational leadership. Especially visionary, coaching, affiliate, and democratic styles include elements that promote transformational leadership. Such elements are for example the leader being visionary and empowering staff \\[[@B4]\\].\n\nThis paper focuses on Finnish nurse managers\\' leadership styles. The Finnish health care system is a strong institution where health care services are offered to all citizens and funded by taxes \\[[@B24]\\]. It has widely recognized that health care services in Finland are of high-quality Despite recent concerns about equity issues, Finns are in general very satisfied with their health care services. \\[[@B25]\\]. Consequently it is important to explore nurse managers\\' leadership styles especially in this context.\n\n2. Materials and Methods {#sec2}\n========================\n\n2.1. Aim of the Study {#sec2.1}\n---------------------\n\nThe intention of this study was to explore nurses\\' and supervisors\\' perceptions of nurse leaders\\' leadership styles. The research questions were as follows: what kind of leadership styles do nurse managers use and what are the factors affected by their leadership styles.\n\n2.2. Participants {#sec2.2}\n-----------------\n\nTo achieve the aim of this study data were collected through open interviews. The majority of Finnish nurse managers, nurses, and supervisors work in hospitals or long-term facilities. Selection of participants was performed in convenience sampling \\[[@B26]\\]. Participants were selected paying attention to the fact they were of different ages, working in different wards and units (e.g., psychiatry, internal diseases, gerontology) in either hospitals or long-term facilities, and had worked with more than one nurse manager.\n\nThe researcher contacted the participants and asked whether they were interested in taking part in the study. The participants were informed about the aim of the study. Participation was voluntary. Prior to the interviews each participant signed a form where they gave their consent to participate in the study. A total of 11 nurses and 10 supervisors, 20 women and one man, from eight Finnish hospitals and five long-term care facilities participated in the study. The age of the nurses varied between 30 and 53 and their experience in health care between 7 and 25 years. The age of the supervisors varied between 38 and 59 and their experience as supervisors between 5 and 21 years. Both nurses and supervisors had worked with many nurse leaders and they were interviewed about nurse managers in general. They thus had experience of different nurse managers on different wards and they were able to describe leadership styles from various aspects.\n\n2.3. Data Collection and Analysis {#sec2.3}\n---------------------------------\n\nSemistructured interviews were used to gather data on the perceptions of nurse managers\\' leadership styles and factors affected by leadership styles. Interviews were usually carried out in the office in the participants\\' workplace. All interviews were recorded with individual consent. Participants were initially asked to describe their work and earlier study and work history. They were subsequently asked about their perception of leadership styles and asked to describe the leadership styles used by their nurse managers. After that they were asked about factors affected by leadership styles. Each interview was approached individually, guided by participants\\' responses. The interview sessions lasted between 30 and 85 minutes. Every interview was transcribed word for word from the recordings. Interviewing was continued until saturation of the data was achieved \\[[@B27]\\].\n\nBecause nurses and supervisors might have differed in their perceptions of leadership styles, the data were first analysed separately in two separate groups, following the same process for each group. Content analysis was chosen because it is a research method for making valid inferences from data to the contexts of their use \\[[@B28]\\].\n\nThe interview texts were read through multiple times, based on the author\\'s empirical and theoretical preunderstanding of the professional area of the participating nurses and nurse managers. A structured categorization matrix of leadership styles was developed based on the primal leadership model \\[[@B23]\\] and research of Vesterinen et al. \\[[@B29]\\]. When using a structured matrix of analysis, an item of the data that does not fit the categorization frame is used to create its own concept, based on the principles of inductive content analysis \\[[@B30]\\]. When both the data of nurses and superiors were analysed, the results were compared. The categories and subthemes were congruent and therefore the results are presented together, albeit paying attention to differences and similarities of the perceptions of nurses and superiors.\n\nThe data analysis of the factors affected by leadership styles was inductive. All the data of nurses and supervisors were analysed together. This process included open coding, creating categories, and abstraction. A classification framework of the factors was formed inductively by defining categories and sub-themes. The criteria for allocating a unit to a category were formed by asking questions if the unit was suitable to the category. The sub-themes were named using descriptive concepts and classified as \"belonging\" to a particular category. After that, the categories were given names \\[[@B31]\\].\n\n2.4. Trustworthiness {#sec2.4}\n--------------------\n\nThe trustworthiness of this study has been ensured by confirming truth value, consistency, neutrality, and transferability of this study \\[[@B32]\\].\n\nWhen considering this study from the viewpoint of trustworthiness, there are some threats that should be taken into consideration. The researcher collected the data and performed the analysis alone and the interpretation could have been affected by her professional history \\[[@B33]\\]. With interviews there is a risk that respondents try to please the interviewer by reporting things they assume s/he wants to hear. The researcher confirmed the truth value of the study by selecting participants in convenience sampling. The respondents\\' age distribution was wide and they worked in different units. Their perspectives and descriptions were broad and gave a diverse picture.\n\nThe truth value of this study was also confirmed by analysing data as they emerged based on the interviews. To ensure the trustworthiness of the study quotes from interviews are included in the results.\n\nIn view of consistency, the research process is described so that it can be repeated if necessary. This gives a possibility to understand the limitations of the process of data collection and analysis. To ensure neutrality in this study, interpretations were based on original data. This is confirmed by citations from the interview data.\n\nIn this study the sample was small, consisting of Finnish nurses and supervisors, and the results only reflect their perceptions of leadership styles. As a result, transferability of results is limited. However, when considering the main objective in this study, it was not transferability of research results, but it was to enhance understanding of leadership styles and use it for future studies.\n\n2.5. Ethical Considerations {#sec2.5}\n---------------------------\n\nThe data for this study were collected following approval from the administrations of the organizations. All participants were informed of the purpose of the study. They were told that their participation was voluntary and would be treated with confidentiality. Participants were asked to sign a form where they gave their consent to take part in the study.\n\n3. Results and Discussion {#sec3}\n=========================\n\n3.1. Results {#sec3.1}\n------------\n\nData analysis identified visionary, coaching, affiliate, democratic, commanding, and isolating leadership styles ([Figure 1](#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Job satisfaction and commitment as well as operation and development work, cooperation and organizational climate in the work unit were the factors affected by leadership styles.\n\n### 3.1.1. Leadership Styles {#sec3.1.1}\n\nVisionary Leadership StyleSupervisors were of the opinion that today, nurse managers use a more visionary leadership style than previously. In the past, many organizations lacked a vision of their own and had fewer possibilities to engage in development for the future. Even now, the skills of nurse managers to lead visionary development work varied.\n\nBoth nurses and supervisors reported that it was characteristic of the visionary nurse manager to emphasize and discuss the vision and provide information to employees. When establishing their vision, some nurse managers provided guidelines for attaining the work unit\\'s goals. These nurse managers had a systematic and purposeful leadership style, based on the knowledge of nursing science and practice. They generally worked in organizations with strategies and vision. They had clear goals and rules on how to work. Nurse managers had so-called performance development discussions with every employee once a year. During the discussion, the nurse manager explained and revised the goals and discussed the purpose of the employee\\'s work together with each employee. At the same time, they agreed on the goals of the employee for the next year. Visionary nurse managers were described as being assertive and persistent in their attempts to get the work units to achieve their goals. Nurse managers with more recent education were better equipped to search for information than nurse managers with older education. In addition, they often had a clear picture of the development needs in nursing practice.\n\nSupervisors said that sometimes the fact that the organization did not have visions or direction for the future was an obstacle to a visionary leadership style. This was emphasized in cases where changes were introduced to the organization. Some nurse managers worked more on the basis of operation up until the present. The managers were guided by various situations and there were no plans for the future.\"*\"This manager had visions and we had long-term plans, but these plans often changed.\"*\"\n\nNurses emphasized the importance of making the vision understandable by giving information about current issues of the work unit. Nurse manager\\'s skills to provide information objectively and positively influenced the way the personnel reacted to topical issues. It was also important to explain the motivation behind decisions.\n\nCoaching Leadership StyleNurses as well as supervisors felt that nurse managers with a coaching leadership style took into consideration both the professional development of the employees and delegation of work. The employees had resources and were seen as experts and the nurse manager delegated tasks to them. The skills of employees to work independently varied. Some employees needed more coaching while others were satisfied with using their own professional skills independently.\n\nThe success of delegation was affected by common instructions. They guided employees so that every employee knew his/her tasks. The employees worked and made decisions independently within the bounds agreed. The nurse managers had a significant role in supporting the employees to cope with the problems at work. They were also responsible for coordinating and organizing work in the unit as a whole.\"*\"A nurse manager draws plans for nursing practice so that there are these areas of responsibility and everybody knows what is their area and they answer for that.\"*\"\n\nThe nurse manager paid attention to employees\\' professional skills and encouraged them to study further. Both personnel\\'s competence and leaders\\' skills to lead influenced the development work in the unit. It was useful to clarify what kind of needs the work unit and employees had for additional education and to draw up an education plan. This plan was a meaningful basis to guide the employees to necessary training. It was each employee\\'s duty to share the new knowledge with other employees. The nurse manager encouraged the employees to collect information without prompting and to think independently. S/he also gave feedback about the professional development of the employee.\n\nAffiliate Leadership StyleNurses as well as supervisors described an affiliate leadership style. Nurse managers with affiliate leadership style emphasized harmony and acceptance of difference. The employees and their best interests were the most important value to the nurse manager. They knew the rules and guidelines of the organization, but they considered the hopes and needs of employees in a flexible manner. The nurse manager had skills to understand the feelings of another person and supported him/her by listening sensitively. Both s/he and his/her personnel trusted each other. Nurses reported that this encouraged the employees to discuss their personal concerns with the nurse manager. \"*\"The way to act, pay attention to the employee, do you listen to her or not, that is the basic question.\"*\"\n\nOn the other hand, supervisors reported that leading could be too solicitous, in a completely motherly way. The basis of the leadership style could be supporting the well-being and job satisfaction of the employees; this might be more important than the development of nursing practise. The purpose---a harmonious atmosphere without conflicts---can be an obstacle to planned changes. \"*\"When there are big changes in the work unit, nurse manager is present to the employees and listen \\[sic\\] to them. She tries to support and say \\[sic\\]: there is no problem and we manage of this.\"*\" \"*\"When a new employee begins to work, she leads in \\[sic\\] more paternalistic way and takes care of them all the time.\"*\"\n\nBoth nurses and supervisors deemed it important that the nurse manager respects differences and personal characteristics of the employees, not forgetting employees\\' equality. A nurse manager who respects and accepts the employees as individuals was easy to approach. On the other hand, nurse manager\\'s close friendship with employees could make it more difficult to examine the work unit and its functions objectively.\"*\"There are managers who are very permissive and let the employees behave each in their own way, it is typical that new small managers rise beside them.\"*\"\n\nAccording to the findings nurse managers sometimes behaved in a manner the employees felt to be unequal.\"*\"It seems that if you are a strong-willed person, you are more likely to get what you want than a person who is adaptable.\"*\"\n\nDemocratic Leadership StyleBoth nurses and supervisors reported that it was typical for the democratic nurse manager to emphasize teamwork and commitment to work. All employees\\' participation was important to him/her. The nurse manager worked and discussed work together with the personnel. The employees had a possibility to voice their opinions and take part in problem-solving and decision-making. However, the nurse manager was ultimately expected to be a decision-maker. \"*\"... and find and make the decision by thinking together and listening to opinions of the employees and discussing together; however, she is in some cases the final decision-maker.\"*\"\n\nThere were different perceptions of the nurse managers\\' positions in this leadership style. On the one hand, they were deemed to be responsible for the work unit and to make reasonable decisions after discussing with the employees. On the other hand, some supervisors felt that some nurse managers did not stand out as managers, but as team members. This meant that the nurse manager\\'s own tasks could be of secondary importance.\"*\"... she is working a lot with us and she has difficulties performing her own duties as a nurse manager.\"*\"\n\nSupervisors said that a nurse manager had an important role in cooperation and its development with the members of different professional groups and between work units. His/her skills to get the employees to commit to the common goals were deemed as significant. Planning together with the personnel formed a basis for employees\\' commitment to work. That was essential for the development of the operation of the work unit.\"*\"... leadership style influences operation as a whole, for example, how a manager gets employees to commit to common decisions\"*\"\n\nCommanding Leadership StyleBoth nurses and supervisors identified a commanding leadership style, characterized by an emphasis on compliancy and control. Nurses as well as supervisors reported that it was important to the nurse managers with a commanding leadership style to follow clear directions and advice which they expected to get from others, for example, their own superiors. The employees were expected to obey these orders. The nurse manager could ask employees\\' opinions on how to find a solution to a problem in the work unit; usually s/he had already made a decision and it was not changed by the opinions of the employees. The nurse manager did not think it necessary to explain his/her decisions. The leadership style was described as authoritarian, hierarchical, and inflexible.\"*\"Nurse managers who do not have the latest knowledge of leadership, they demand that there should be clear rules and laws for everything and there is no flexibility.\"*\"\n\nCommanding leadership style was more common in the 1970s and 1980s and it was now considered traditional and out-of-date. It was, however, described as a convenient leadership style when employees are inexperienced or when there are big changes in the work unit. Nurse managers were described as controlling the behaviour of the personnel, although observations of that kind have diminished considerably.\n\nIsolating Leadership StyleBoth nurses and supervisors described that nurse managers could isolate themselves from the work unit and retire to their own room where they worked alone without active communication with the employees. In that case the employees felt that they had been left without a leader. Problematic situations like conflicts between employees often arose and they were difficult to repair. Neither the nurse manager nor the employees got the information they needed in their work. \"*\"The nurse manager is quite isolated, she works alone in her room, we visit her when we have something to discuss with her.\"*\"\n\n### 3.1.2. Factors Affected by Leadership Style {#sec3.1.2}\n\nBoth nurses and supervisors reported that nurse manager\\'s leadership style affects employees\\' job satisfaction and commitment to work. It is felt that nurse manager\\'s fairness and trust in the employees promotes their motivation and participation in work. It is important that the employees have a possibility to develop their professional skills. Leadership style contributes to job satisfaction when the nurse manager has skills to prevent and solve conflicts.\n\nAll the participants reported that nurse manager\\'s skills to lead the work unit and motivate people affect the success of the work unit. Often s/he has to ask for adequate resources. It is important that there are enough trained employees and the employees know and are in charge of their areas of responsibilities. Supervisors remarked on the influence of leadership style on efficiency and economy, because the fluency of operation has an impact on how much money is spent. The nurse manager\\'s influence in developing and changing operation is very important. It is important that the employees have a possibility to take part in development work as well. Nurse manager\\'s leadership style can promote or hinder development in the work unit.\n\nSupervisors emphasized that nurse managers have a significant role in cooperation within the work unit and outside it. Some nurse managers want to work only inside their own unit, while others take a larger view of the matter. Nurse manager\\'s leadership style has an influence on how externally orientated the staff are and whether they have connections outside the work unit. A nurse manager can promote the continuity of patient care by cooperation with other units. S/he is a role model in how to treat nurse students.\n\nBoth nurses and supervisors felt that problems in the organizational climate, such as conflicts between the employees or dissatisfaction with the nurse leader are reflected in patient care. The activity or passivity of the nurse manager affects the image of the work unit.\"*\"If there is patient mistreatment, it is the nurse manager whose responsibility it is to decide how to react, for example, \"in our unit we treat patients well\" or \"we do not react at all to this complaint\".\"*\"\n\nAll in all, organizational climate, personnel\\'s job satisfaction and commitment, work unit\\'s operation and development work, and cooperation influence the way patient care succeeds and how a patient experiences the care he/she gets. Leadership style has an effect on patient satisfaction and quality of care. If the nurse manager\\'s basic value is good patient care, it influences in many ways his/her leadership style and how s/he organizes things in the work unit.\n\n3.2. Discussion {#sec3.2}\n---------------\n\nThe discussion is structured around the findings identified above. An isolating leadership style was identified as distinct from the leadership styles that Goleman \\[[@B23]\\] presented, whereas pace-setting leadership style was not reported. The participants reported that nurse managers used many leadership styles, but normally they had one which they used more than others. Nurses who worked for leaders with resonant leadership styles were more satisfied with supervision and their jobs \\[[@B34]\\]. Furthermore, visionary leadership style, coaching leadership style, affiliate leadership style, and democratic leadership style seem to promote transformational leadership because they motivate and involve staff. That is why nurse managers should develop themselves in the use of these leadership styles.\n\nNurse managers\\' leadership style depends on many issues, such as organization, situation, and employees. Reynolds and Rogers \\[[@B35]\\] argue that employees have variable levels of competence depending on the situation. That requires managers to adapt their leadership style. It is important that nurse managers have skills to reflect on their own leadership style and receive feedback about it. That gives them tools to use different leadership styles in different situations.\n\nHealth care is meeting ever-increasing new challenges where it has to react rapidly. It is important to the health care organizations to make long-term plans and prepare for the future by paying attention to the needs of inhabitants and the resources needed. The vision is the basis of the goals of the work unit, too. Having knowledge of nursing science and practice gives nurse managers the tools to use a visionary leadership style and make plans for the future. Morjikian et al. \\[[@B36]\\] argued that communication of future plans, goals, and strategies is important between the nurse manager and the employees. It is important to give information of the vision and explain it regularly to the employees, because sometimes the employees forget the purpose of their work and their working style is not appropriate. When nurse managers work like this they are also carrying out transformational leadership \\[[@B4], [@B5]\\].\n\nIn the future, securing skilled employees will be a big challenge in health care. Vesterinen et al. \\[[@B29]\\] found that nurse managers with a coaching leadership style appreciated employees\\' professional skills and encouraged them to study further. Nurse manager\\'s consideration of employees\\' profession and educational needs influenced nurse retention positively. Kenmore \\[[@B37]\\] argued that a coaching leadership style works when the employees are keen to develop and make use of possibilities to do so. Education gave employees tools to work and make decisions independently. Although the nurse manager organizes the work unit as a whole and is responsible for the development work in the unit, his/her support has a significant role in helping employees to cope with the problems they meet in their work. This is also an important part in nurse managers\\' role as emotionally intelligent leaders \\[[@B10]\\].\n\nAs a consequence of globalization, both employees and patients come from many different cultures. Their behaviour and habits to express their needs vary. An affiliate leadership style with acceptance of difference could be suited for the multicultural work unit. It is a challenge for the manager to listen sensitively and consider to employees\\' personal needs individually and at the same time objectively, not forgetting employees\\' equality. This requires an emotionally intelligent nurse manager \\[[@B10]\\]. The basis of the leadership style could be supporting the well-being and job satisfaction of the employees. As Kenmore \\[[@B37]\\] argues, if a nurse manager is too concerned with creating harmony, it can lead to evasion of problems.\n\nBecause of shortage of employees, nurses have many possibilities to choose and change their workplaces. Democratic leadership style promoted employees\\' commitment to work \\[[@B29]\\]. It is important that the employees can express their opinions and take part in decision-making.\n\nA commanding leadership style prevents the empowerment of the nurses, because they do not have possibilities to participate in work planning \\[[@B38]\\]. However, there are situations where a commanding leadership style is appropriate. The majority of Finnish nurses will retire in the next few years and there are many nurses with less work experience in the work units. Employees with less work experience may need clear directions, for example, in acute situations when a patient\\'s life is in danger.\n\nAccording to Huston \\[[@B1]\\], essential nurse manager competencies for the future include the ability to create an organization culture that combines high-quality health care and patient/employee safety and highly developed collaborative and team building skills. As a result of this study, an isolating leadership style was found: the nurse manager worked alone without active communication with the employees. The employees have to work without a leader, and that could cause anxiety for the employees who need support from their leader. A good question in this case is who is really leading the work unit. If the leader does not show consideration towards the employees, it could affect their health and well-being negatively \\[[@B39]\\]. Nurse managers need support to develop the leadership style. Leaders and their supervisors should be considered collectively to understand how leadership influences employee performance \\[[@B40]\\].\n\nA nurse manager has an important role in leading the work unit as a whole. A work unit is seen as a reflection of the nurse manager. According to Rosengren et al. \\[[@B41]\\], nurses reported that nursing leadership was considered \"being present and available in daily work,\" \"facilitating professional acknowledgement,\" \"supporting nursing practice\" and \"improving care both as a team and as individuals.\" A nurse manager with an emotionally intelligent leadership style creates a favourable work climate characterized by innovation, resilience, and change \\[[@B42]\\]. Nurse managers have to be flexible in the changes they have directly initiated or by which they have been indirectly affected \\[[@B43]\\]. Leadership style affects the organizational climate and the ways how information is given and communicated and how questions of the day are discussed. The nurse manager creates the basis for how different opinions are handled and problems solved in the work unit.\n\nNurse manager\\'s leadership style affects the personnel\\'s job satisfaction and commitment. It is perceived that nurse manager\\'s trust in the employees promotes their motivation and participation in work. Way et al. \\[[@B44]\\] found that trust and job satisfaction are strong links with greater commitment and intent to stay on at work. Nurse managers create basic preconditions for the operation and for development work.\n\nLeader encourages the employees to develop goals and plan to achieve them. In this way he/she influences the professional development of the personnel \\[[@B45]\\]. Their skills to build bonds and seek out mutually beneficial relationships affect cooperation in the work unit and around it.\n\nOn the other hand, there is no one and only correct leadership style; the same result can be achieved in many ways. A manager who has the ability to reflect on his/her own behaviour, that is, who has high EI, is better able to regulate and estimate his/her leadership style with different employees in different situations. Leadership style influences patient care and its quality at least indirectly. A nurse manager has a significant role in using a leadership style that promotes good patient care.\n\n4. Conclusions {#sec4}\n==============\n\nNurse managers had many leadership styles, but normally they had one that they used more than the others. The nurse managers should consider their leadership style from the point of view of employees, situation factors, and goals of the organization. Leadership styles where employees are seen in a participative, active role have become more common. Together with health care organizations, nursing education programmes should include education of nurse managers to improve their self reflection, through which they are better able to vary their leadership style.\n\n![Nurse managers\\' leadership styles in Finland.

Group A streptococci (GAS; Streptococcus pyogenes) are remarkable for the wide range of diseases they cause in humans, their sole biological host. Yet, most infections are mild and involve one of two tissues - the epithelial surface of the throat or skin - giving rise to pharyngitis or impetigo, respectively. A long-term goal is to better understand the distinct pathogenic mechanisms leading to pharyngitis and impetigo. A primary focus of the proposal is the regulation of pili expression in GAS. Pilus-associated proteins mediate adherence to epithelial cells and enhance superficial infection at the skin. Pili correspond to the T-antigens of GAS. All strains examined have pilus genes, however, many natural GAS isolates lack T-antigen. The hypothesis to be tested in Aim 1 states that organisms recovered from a carrier state and/or invasive disease are significantly more likely to have defects in pilus production, as compared to isolates derived from cases of pharyngitis or impetigo. Aim 1 seeks to define the relationship between defects in pilus expression and disease. The nra/rofA locus encodes a [unreadable]stand alone[unreadable] response regulator that affects the transcription of pilus genes; nra and rofA denote discrete lineages of alleles. Both Nra and RofA can have positive or negative regulatory effects on pilus gene transcription, depending on the GAS isolate or strain. The hypothesis to be tested in Aim 2 states that there are strain-specific differences among modulators of pilus gene expression that lie in a pathway upstream of Nra/RofA. Aim 2 seeks to identify regulators of pilus gene transcription having a differential presence among strains. The distribution of Nra and RofA among GAS is strongly correlated with subpopulations of strains having a tendency to cause infection at either the throat or skin. Nra and RofA are global regulators of GAS gene transcription. Two hypotheses will be addressed in Aim 3: (i), that co-regulated non-pilus genes act in concert with pili to cause disease; and (ii), that Nra and RofA confer differential transcription of downstream genes. Aim 3 seeks to identify genes of the Nra and RofA regulons, and to test their role in virulence. Through a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms used by GAS to persist in their primary ecological niches - the throat and skin of the human host - will come new knowledge on how best to interfere with these vital processes. Effective control and prevention measures that disrupt the chain of transmission of GAS will result in a decreased burden of the more severe GAS diseases (toxic shock syndrome, rheumatic heart disease) which have a high morbidity and mortality for many people throughout the world.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "NIH ExPorter"}}, "Books3": {"text": " \n#\n\n### Copyright\n\n4th Estate\n\nAn imprint of HarperCollins _Publishers_\n\n1 London Bridge Street\n\nLondon SE1 9GF\n\nwww.4thEstate.co.uk\n\nThis eBook first published in Great Britain by 4th Estate in 2019\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Tash Aw 2019\n\nCover design by Jack Smyth\n\nCover images \u00a9 Shutterstock & Upsplash\n\nTash Aw asserts the moral right to be identified as the author of this work\n\nA catalogue record for this book is available from the British Library\n\nInformation on previously published material appears here.\n\nAll rights reserved under International and Pan-American Copyright Conventions.

Roots clinging to the outside of the walls, holding the bricks and stone and whatever remains of the paint together, branches pushing through holes in the roof. Sometimes there's almost nothing left of the roof, if you can even call it that \u2013 just fragments of clay tiles or rusty tin propped up by the canopy of leaves. A few miles out of town, on the other side of Kapar headed towards the coast, you'll find a shophouse with the roots of a jungle fig creeping down the front pillars of the building, the entire structure swallowed up by the tree \u2013 the doorway is now just a shadowy space that leads into the heart of a huge tangle of foliage. Where does one end and the other begin? Which one is alive, which is dead? Still, on the ground floor of these houses, there'll be a business or a shop, some kind of small operation, an old guy who'll patch up your tyres for twenty bucks. Or a printing press that makes those cheap leaflets advertising closing-down sales at the local mall. Or a cake shop with nothing in the chiller cabinets except for two pieces of _kuih lapis_ that have been there for three weeks. The packets of biscuits on the shelves are covered in the dust that drifts across from the construction sites nearby, where they're building the new railway or shopping mall or God knows what. These people haven't made a decent living for twenty years. They're seventy-five, eighty years old. Still alive, but their business is being taken over by a tree. Imagine that.\n\nThat night, after the killing \u2013 or the _culpable homicide not amounting to murder_ , as you politely call it \u2013 I walked for many hours in the dark. I can't tell you how long. I tried to hang on to a sense of time, kept looking at the sky for signs of dawn, I even quickened my stride to make each step feel like one full second, like the ticking of that clock on the wall over there, that right now sounds so quick. Tick, tick, tick. But that night each second stretched into a whole minute, each minute felt like a lifetime, and there was nothing I could do to speed things up.\n\nMy shirt was wet \u2013 not just damp, but properly wet \u2013 and it clung to my back like a second skin; only that skin did not belong to me, but to a separate living organism, cold and heavy, weighing me down. As I walked further and further away from what I now come to think of as _the_ _scene of the crime_ (but didn't then \u2013 it was just a darkened spot on the riverbank, indistinguishable from any other), I listened out for the sirens of police cars, expecting to hear them at any moment. I kept thinking, They're coming for me, this is the end, the mata are going to catch me and throw me in jail forever. I said out loud, _You're finished. This really is the end for you_. Hearing my own voice calmed me. Nothing had ever felt so absolute and certain. The police would arrive, they would lock me up, and from then on, all my days would be the same. The thought of being in a small empty cell with nothing to think about for the rest of my life \u2013 the idea of this existence comforted me. When I woke up each morning I would see the same four walls that had been there when I fell asleep the night before. Nothing would ever change. What I wore, how long I slept each night, how many times a day I could eat, wash, shit \u2013 every decision would be made for me, I would be just the same as everyone else. Someone would take control of my life, and that would be the end of my story. Part of me still wishes things had turned out that way.\n\nI walked through the long grass \u2013 it was stringy and sharp and slashed my legs right up to my knees. It was hot, I was wearing shorts, my skin started to sting. Twice, maybe three times, I crossed a bridge and continued to wander along the opposite bank. At first I was looking for my car, but soon I realised I was trying to get as far away from the scene of the crime as possible. The only problem was that I couldn't remember exactly where it had happened. At some point I started to feel mud between my toes and I realised I'd lost one sandal, which must have got stuck in the swampy ground, so I kicked off the other and walked barefoot. It was late, but not so late that there wasn't any traffic on the highways beyond, and on the bridges overhead. Their headlamps would sometimes illuminate the tops of the trees above me, and suddenly little details would leap out at me, things I wouldn't have noticed if I'd been walking there in the daytime \u2013 kites with smiley bird faces snagged in the branches, or plastic bags, lots of them, hanging like swollen ghostlike fruit.\n\nSometimes I'd see strange shapes drifting in the middle of the river. Fallen tree trunks and bushes uprooted by the storms upstream, tangled together in huge rafts that looked like some sort of mythical beast from _Journey to the West_ , the kind of nonsense that adults tell children to scare them into behaving themselves, but that no one actually takes seriously, not even children \u2013 what kid actually believes in a nine-headed bug? \u2013 until one night they're walking alone on a riverbank, and then those demons seem real and terrifying. Other times, snagged in the reeds right by where I was walking, I'd see a dead creature, a body so bloated that I couldn't even tell what it was \u2013 a could-be cat or a could-be monkey. When a body's been in the water for that long, its shape starts to blur, softening around the edges until it becomes impossible to distinguish one kind of animal from another.\n\nMy arm ached, I was moving in a funny way, one side of my body less mobile than the other. I realised that I was still holding the piece of wood, the length of tree branch that had felt so light in my hand just a short while ago but now seemed to weigh a hundred pounds. During the trial, when people in court referred to _the murder weapon that was never retrieved_ , I remembered the damp two-foot piece of wood that I held that night. It was just a fragment of a tree. A few hours earlier, when I'd struck the man for the first time, the broken length of wood had seemed so insignificant that I thought it incapable of causing pain. I expected it to shatter, I expected the man to laugh at my ridiculous choice of weapon. Now it felt as if I was lifting an entire tree, the weight of the world clinging to its roots. I raised my arm, wanting to throw it far out into the middle of the river, but suddenly I found that I had no strength left in my body. It slipped from my grasp and fell just a few feet away.\n\nI realised after a while that the police were not going to arrive. No one was going to come for me. Not that night, not the following day, and maybe not for weeks. In the end it took them more than two months to arrest me \u2013 but you already know that. You also know why it took so long. When the victim is that sort of person, the police don't really care. Yes, that kind of person. A foreigner. An illegal. Someone with dark skin.\n\nBangla, Myanma, Nepal. When the police come it's all the same to them. Even Africa. It's as if they all come from one big nameless continent. Back when I was living in Puchong, I saw a group of Africans by the side of the road, a dozen men. Some were sitting on the pavement, others were standing up, laughing, joking, drinking beer and liquor. One or two were dancing \u2013 they had a big portable set that played their tunes so loudly I almost couldn't hear my own music. I was listening to Jacky Cheung on my phone \u2013 back then we only had those small Sony Ericssons that made every song sound crackly, as if you were listening to it on the radio in a faraway country. Maybe you're too young to remember those phones. I was on the other side of the road, outside the 7-Eleven, eating a Ramly burger with Keong. This was seventeen, eighteen, maybe even twenty years ago. Back then you didn't see so many Africans around. People didn't know anything about them \u2013 which countries they were from, why they'd come here. Ask anyone what they knew about Africa and they'd say, _Lions_.\n\nKeong was looking at his phone, pretending he wasn't interested, as if he'd grown up with black people. But he couldn't help making comments. _Wahlau, Muhammad Ali brought all his friends!_ I remember laughing, even though I didn't really find it funny. Most probably I made some comments too. It was so long ago, I don't recall. There was a light breeze that night, I remember that. Next to us an old Indian stallkeeper was clearing up his stand for the night. Business was slow, there weren't many people out on the street. 'Every Friday night,' he said. 'Every week they come here and raise trouble. Friday supposed to be holy day \u2013 these _guys_ , they don't respect anything.' In fact he didn't say _these guys_ , he said _these Mat Hitam_. Better not translate that.\n\nI said, 'They're Nigerian.' I'd seen an article in the _Nanyang Siang Pau_ about Nigerian students coming to Malaysia, falling into debt after they graduated and being unable to buy a ticket home. I remember thinking, Must be really desperate to come to college here.\n\n'Shut your mouth,' Keong said. 'Nigerian your ass. You don't know anything.'\n\nAs I looked at them, I got the feeling that they were floating through the city, unattached to anything around them. Their music was the only thing that seemed real \u2013 a link to their home. That was why they were listening to it so loudly, I thought. But they were thousands of miles away, and something in the way they talked to each other, shouting over the music and laughing in the half-dark street, made me realise that they would probably never return to where they came from. And suddenly I thought, _I am just like them, I am floating through life._\n\n'What the fuck,' Keong said. There was a note of excitement in his voice. Two guys in the group had started fighting, that kind of messy scuffling that happens when people are drunk, not really a proper fight, just grappling with each other, tumbling into the road. A car passed by and had to swerve to avoid them. The driver leaned on the horn for a long time \u2013 it was a Kancil, the noise of the honking as it drove off was high-pitched, like a cheap child's toy that you buy in the night market. It made us laugh. A few minutes later the men were joking and talking again as though nothing had happened. We stopped looking at them \u2013 they were nothing special, they were just like us, just hanging out with friends. Keong was texting his new girlfriend, reading out her messages to me. Of course he was exaggerating. I knew she didn't think he was the handsomest guy in the world. In fact I'm sure she didn't even exist. But I went along with it \u2013 that's what you do with old friends. You take an interest in their lives, even when they're lying.\n\nThen suddenly we heard a commotion \u2013 more shouting. We looked up from our phones and saw three police cars and another three unmarked ones surrounding the Nigerian guys. Everyone was yelling. There were a lot of cops, I couldn't count them. They pushed one guy against a car. I could hear him shouting in English, _No drugs no drugs I don't have anything!_ But they handcuffed him anyway and made him sit on the kerb just like his dozen or so friends. At first the Nigerians were arguing, shouting at the police. They were big guys, much taller than us, and maybe they thought they could get out of trouble by being loud, but they didn't know what the police were like. I couldn't see what happened, there were too many bodies in the way, but all at once everything became quiet, and one of the men was lying on the ground, one arm around his head, the other one stretched out as if he was reaching for something. He wasn't moving. After a while, some of them started to plead \u2013 we could hear them from across the street. Their voices were soft and rich and deepened each time they said the word _Please. Please._ The sound of the word made me feel as if I was stepping off solid earth and falling into an abyss. I wanted it to stop.\n\n'Just pay them,' Keong said. 'Get all the damn cash out of your pockets. _Just pay_.' But we knew they had no money to bribe the cops. I'm sure they understood the system just as well as we did, they just didn't have the money. Keong shook his head. ' _Aiyo cham lor_ , lock-up for you tonight my friends.' When you've grown up in the kinds of places that we have, you know what's in store for you.\n\nA big police truck arrived and picked up all the Nigerians. While it was still parked, one of the cops came over to buy some cigarettes. We asked him what was going on. He said, 'Local people \u2013 we don't like seeing _Mat Hitam_ around.' He lit a cigarette with a silver Zippo lighter. 'We're like the town council, just cleaning the trash off the streets.'\n\nWe laughed loudly \u2013 as if we were best buddies with him. _Yeah, clean it all up_. I can't remember what else we said, can't recall exactly what kind of jokes we made, but we wanted the police to think we were on their side. We knew they wouldn't be hassling us that night, that there was someone else they were more interested in. Even though I was young, I thought I already understood the way things worked. But that night made it clear to me, like the words to a song by a foreign singer. You know the melody by heart, but you can't quite make out the words, you can only understand fragments of English here and there, you sing a line or two from the chorus and sort of understand the message, but then one day someone explains the words to you, and suddenly everything clicks into focus, the whole song makes sense. It's no longer just a pretty tune, it's got meaning \u2013 and that night, the message became clear: no one wanted to know about you if you were dark-skinned and foreign. Who would come looking for you if you were thrown in Sungai Buloh jail? Or if you sank slowly to the bottom of a river? No one would ask questions. Not until it was way too late.\n\nI don't know why I'm telling you all this. I guess I want to empty out the contents of my head after all these years. That's what you asked me to do right from the start. Don't hold back, be as honest and open as possible. Just talk, you said. No judgement. So that's what I'm doing. Just talking.\n\n##\n\n_October 4th_\n\nI have nothing to complain about these days. Every day is the same, and this is a blessing. Nowadays people think variety is the only thing that gives meaning to life, but they forget that routine is a privilege too. No disruptions, no crazy ups and downs, no heartbreak or distress \u2013 there is something divine in sameness, isn't there? A gift sent from the gods. I'm lucky. I live on my savings \u2013 the small amount of money I made when I sold my house in Taman Bestari that I'd lived in with my wife. To my surprise it was still worth something when I came out of jail, so I sold it and moved into this place, a smaller house with just two small bedrooms, a bit further out of town. Twice a week, someone from the church visits me with a food hamper \u2013 basic groceries with a few treats thrown in \u2013 and if ever I'm in need, I can always go to church to talk to someone, and they'll usually give me some biscuits or leftover fried rice \u2013 whatever they have in the kitchen. It's called Harvest Assembly. I've been going there for nearly six years, ever since I got out of prison.\n\nApart from that, small sums of money come through to me from time to time from a Chinese charity. You know, the L-Foundation. That happened through the lawyer who tried to get damages from the prison service for the injury I suffered during my time inside, but of course it didn't succeed. I could have told them that before they even started. Who in the world ever gets any damages from the police or the prison service? But because of the lawyer's efforts, someone heard of my case, even though it was never famous, never in the newspapers for long. Somebody took pity on me, even though God knows I wasn't worthy of sympathy then. Next thing I know, I get a cheque for six hundred ringgit. To you it probably seems like nothing, but for me it's a lot. I thought it was a one-time deal, I was happy with it, but the cheques continue to arrive \u2013 not regularly, just now and then, with no warning or reason. Sometimes 250 ringgit, sometimes four hundred. On those days I'll walk to the bus stop and ride into town, get there just before the old _bak kut teh_ places shut, and have a big breakfast before strolling around Little India. Sometimes I like to spend a few hours just wandering around a mall in the new town, usually Klang Parade. I treat myself to a meal at Texas Chicken, and always order the same thing: Mexicana Burger and Honey-Butter Biscuits. Sometimes I think I should be more adventurous and try something else \u2013 I really like the look of Jalapeno Bombers. _Bombers_! They sound great. But then I think, what if I don't like them? The thought of getting something new makes me nervous. I want my day to be happy, I don't want to be stressed, I want everything to be calm, to remain the same.\n\nI sit and watch the teenagers in school uniforms sharing their fried chicken and showing each other photos on their phones. The boys pretend to be tough, they use the same language I did when I was their age \u2013 you know, Cantonese cursing, which sounds really crude and aggressive. If you'd heard me and my friends at that age you'd probably have moved away to the next table. But these kids, they're not like me \u2013 they come from the new suburbs close by, they've got decent families. Fourteen, fifteen years old, but they're just babies, relaxing in the mall together after school and playing games on their phones. Even after a whole day at school their uniforms look freshly laundered, not crumpled and grey with sweat \u2013 you'd almost say there was starch on their white shirts. Nothing troubles their lives, and in a strange way, their happiness makes me feel innocent again, and hopeful. Those days out in town are special. I have money in my pocket, I feel independent and free, even if it's just for a day or two. That's what those cheques mean to me \u2013 a day of freedom. I never pray or even make little idle wishes for them, they just appear. That's how God works, I guess. Always surprising, always giving.\n\nWith the injury I suffered in prison I can't work. As you can see, I still have a slight limp, though it's not so noticeable when I'm walking slowly. You only notice it when I have to move quickly, like when I'm running for the bus and just can't shift my leg the way I want to. My brain says, _Faster, faster_ , and for a few seconds I think I can do it, I really think I can get up and sprint for the bus \u2013 but my leg just drags. That's when I notice that I'm limping badly, my body sloping from side to side. I also can't pick up heavy loads as I could before. I used to be famous for that. The guys at the factory I worked at when I was a teenager would set me a challenge, see how many crates of fish I could lift at a time, and I'd always surprise them, even though I'm pretty short. It's my stumpy legs that give me balance. People say it's a Hokkien trait, that our ancestors needed short thighs and calves to plant rice or harvest tea and whatever else people did in southern China two hundred years ago, but who cares? All I know is that my legs always served me well, until I got to prison. [ _Pauses_.] It's because of a nerve in my back, something to do with my spine that I don't really understand. The doctors showed me x-rays, but all I could see was the grey-white shapes of my bones. They couldn't correct it without surgery in a private hospital in KL, but who can afford that these days? At the hospital I laughed and said, 'I'm not a cripple, so let's just live with it, OK?' Someone from church suggested I could get a different kind of job, something that didn't involve manual labour, but any kind of job that allows you to sit down in a comfortable office also requires you to have diplomas and certificates and God knows what else these days \u2013 and I don't have any. I was never very successful at school.\n\nOne time, just a year after I got out of prison, some fellow churchgoers found me a job in their family business, a trading company that imported goods from China and distributed them throughout the country. I had a nice desk, there was air-con in the office, and I didn't have to answer the phone or talk to anyone I didn't know. All I had to do was add up numbers \u2013 such an easy job; nothing can be more certain and solid than numbers. I made sure invoices tallied, checked receipts, that sort of thing. Even though I'd never done that kind of work before, I knew about how to manage money. But at that time, I got a bit anxious whenever I encountered anyone new, in a situation that wasn't familiar to me \u2013 I guess it must have been my time in prison that did that to me. Nothing serious, you understand, just some hesitations in replying whenever someone spoke to me, lapses between their questions and my answers that made them think I had mental problems. Five, ten seconds \u2013 who knows? I watched people's expressions change from confusion, to concern, then irritation. Sometimes frustration, sometimes anger. Some people thought I was doing it on purpose. Once a guy in the office said, _Lunseehai, such an arrogant bastard!_ He shouted it out loud right in front of me without expecting a reply, as if everyone thought the same of me, and that I was deaf and mute and couldn't hear what he was saying. __ 'Whatever the case,' my boss said after a few months \u2013 she was very nice, she understood \u2013 'we think it's better you stop work. Just go home and rest.' Up to that point, I hadn't understood how much I had changed in the previous three years, but losing that job made me appreciate that I had become a different person. Exactly how, I couldn't tell you, but I was no longer the same. I had a couple of interviews for office jobs after that, but nothing worked out.\n\nThat's why I say I'm lucky. I don't work, yet I'm alive. My days are calm. I'd even say I was blessed.\n\n[ _Long silence._ ]\n\nSometimes... [ _Hesitates; reaches for and picks up cup of tea but does not drink._ ] Sometimes, yes, of course I think of that night. How can I not? I think of the two men who were present, Keong and the Bangladeshi guy. I know what you're expecting me to say: that I see their faces, and that I'm tortured by the sight of them \u2013 but that's not the way it is. I don't feel anything about either of them \u2013 not hate, not pity. Maybe I should have felt anger towards Keong; maybe things would have turned out differently if he hadn't come back to see me. He had choices. He didn't have to ask me to do all those things.\n\nNow when I think about him, I don't see the Keong of that night. I see the version of him that appeared in court three years later, when my case was being appealed. His white long-sleeved shirt, his neat hair, even the way he spoke to the judge, softly and respectfully \u2013 anyone would have thought he was a salesman for an IT company in Petaling Jaya. I didn't recognise him at first, I thought it was someone else, that the prosecutors had brought the wrong guy to the courtroom. The lawyers asked him questions about himself, and he supplied the bare facts \u2013 he owned a business importing frozen dumplings from China, his income stream was steady, he owned a Toyota Camry and had a home loan from Hong Leong bank. He'd recently been on holiday to Australia and was saving up to send his daughter to boarding school there in seven or eight years' time, when she was old enough to travel on her own. Right now she had just started at a private school in Cheras, close to where he lived, so he could spend a lot of time with her at home. The moment he finished work, he'd rush home to his wife and daughter and they'd spend the evening having dinner, doing the daughter's homework together and watching a bit of TV. She was a studious girl \u2013 she really loved science!\n\nHe answered quietly, as if he didn't want me to hear what he was saying. On the other side of the courtroom I had difficulty making out some of his words. _Mortgage. Laptop. Playground._ The man speaking seemed to be embarrassed by the way he lived. Why would someone feel shy about having a life like that? That was when I realised it was Keong \u2013 the same one I had known since my teenage years, and I knew why he appeared so awkward. He was ashamed because of my shame \u2013 or to be more precise, he was ashamed of being happy while my shame was on display to the world. We'd shared so much as children. People used to say, 'No use giving Ah Hock any ice cream, he'll just give half to that little bastard Keong.' But _time_ \u2013 that was something we couldn't share. It could only favour one of us.\n\nAnd I thought, Of course he's changed. All those years in prison, when I went through phases of either sleeping all day and all night, or lying awake all day and all night \u2013 phases that lasted weeks and broke down my sense of time, my resistance to the idea that every day should be different \u2013 during that time, Keong was changing himself. Anyone could have become a new person in that period, anyone could have acquired a brand-new life. He'd been so proud of his hair, the long fringe that he'd dyed a shade of coppery orange when he was fifteen, and that he'd kept right up until that evening when we last saw each other. I used to joke with him. 'Hey, big brother, going to become father, still keep that gangster hairstyle meh?' He called it 'blond', thought it made him look like a Hong Kong pop star. He always used to do this [ _sweeps hand theatrically over forehead, throws back his head in slightly camp fashion_ ]. Made me laugh. You're a nobody, just like the rest of us \u2013 that's what I used to say to him every time he tried to show off.\n\nThat hair was gone now, trimmed short and allowed to go back to its natural colour. I hadn't seen him with black hair since we were teenagers. He'd put on weight, which made him look younger, not older, like an adolescent who'd once been chubby but was starting to shed all his puppy fat and turn into a handsome man. I could tell that he'd given up smoking, that he was eating better \u2013 his complexion was smoother, the deep crease between his eyebrows which he'd had since he was a child had disappeared. Ironed out by those three years.\n\nAt one point the lawyers started asking him questions about my character. Did he ever know me to be impulsive? Had he ever seen violent tendencies in me? Was I someone who felt sorry and regretted bad deeds? At first he answered clearly and simply, without hesitation, just like the serious businessman he'd become. It wasn't a role he was performing, it was who he really was now. Both his English and his Malay had improved, and he used them carefully, considering every word before saying it. But as the questions continued, he began to feel at ease and started speaking more freely, sometimes using expressions you might consider rude. He even told a little story from our teenage years. _One time hor, I steal biscuit from the store, I share with him but I steal so much we cannot finish, he say must return, must return, I say no way, poke your lung, but he lagi force me so next day we go give back biscuit. Your mother. Make me lose face! But he say how can steal, she also no money._\n\n'OK, OK, Mr Tan. I think that will do.' When the lawyer said that I laughed. Even in his new life, Keong couldn't resist talking too much. For a few seconds, when he was recounting that incident \u2013 which I couldn't recall \u2013 I saw the years and the extra weight he'd acquired fall away. I saw the skinny kid with a sharp face and earrings again, the one I'd grown up with and had always thought would end up in jail. We even joked about it when he left KL to find work elsewhere. 'Don't worry about an address,' I'd told him, 'I'll just come looking for you in prison.'\n\nAfter the lawyer's admonishment he fell silent once more \u2013 a husband, a proper father, someone you could trust to hold a family together. That's the image of him that comes to me from time to time these days. A respectable man, beyond hatred.\n\nIt was only much later that I realised I'd only spent three years in jail. Three years \u2013 that's nothing! Why did it feel so long when I was in my cell? And how did Keong change so quickly? That's when I felt bitter. I'd never held a grudge against him, not even for coming back to Klang and bringing Evil into my life. When I talked about it to members of the church some years later they said, You must forgive him the way God forgives you. And I thought, There's nothing for me to forgive; I don't feel anything towards him. But when I saw him in the courtroom and thought of how quickly he'd changed, I felt angry. He had taken hold of time and mastered it, I had let myself be crushed by it. It was only three years, I told myself, _only three years_ \u2013 you can make up that time and turn things round for yourself. But I knew I was no longer capable of changing my life. Evolution is a funny thing. For the longest time, you believe in the power of change \u2013 in your ability to mould your life through even the smallest acts. Even buying a four-digit lottery ticket feels loaded with optimism, as if those five bucks might turn into a twenty-thousand bonanza and transform your life. Then one day it disappears, that blind devotion to hope, and you know that even if you pray all day, nothing will happen to you. My anger was directed at myself, I didn't blame Keong. Seeing him reminded me of the person I could no longer be.\n\nAs for the other man, his face remains a blank, even though it should be the one thing I remember from that night. In my defence, it was very dark when I first saw him. What's more, he turned away from me before I picked up the piece of wood. I couldn't see his face when I struck him.\n\n##\n\n_October 6th_\n\nTowards the end of the trial my lawyer tried to explain to the jury the kind of childhood I had experienced. She was young and clever, she worked for free, she wanted to help me. I understood that my life was being used as an excuse for many things. I listened to her speak about me, and though the facts were true, I felt as if she was describing someone else, someone who had grown up close to me, maybe in a village a couple of miles up the coast. Another guy who shared my name, which she kept repeating. Lee Hock Lye. Lee Hock Lye. Always my full name. Sometimes she said, Lee Hock Lye, _also known as_ Jayden Lee, which made the name sound fake, as if I'd made it up \u2013 which I had. But still, it was my name \u2013 had become my name. I had chosen it when I'd found proper work and things were going well, just before I got married. It sounded good, people liked it \u2013 they hadn't heard anything like it before. It was a cool name that looked professional on the calling cards that I had printed when business started going well. Jayden \u2013 that was me, but each time she pronounced the name in front of the entire courtroom it felt as though she was referring to someone else, because she said it as two separate words. _Jay, Den_. As if she found it unnatural. Every time I heard it, I felt as though the name was being prised away from me, and that I never truly owned it. _Also known as_. I should never have taken that name, I was foolish to have chosen it.\n\nThe person she talked about was miserable, badly-educated, hopeless. Someone who had no choices in life. Anyone listening would have pitied him. A woman in the jury was nodding her head slowly, her face twisted in a frown. Even I nearly felt sorry for the person being described. But then I thought: Wait, this is wrong. I also thought: I was happy. I was normal. I knew my lawyer was trying to help me, but I wanted her to stop talking. I started humming a tune to block out the noise of her words. I closed my eyes and tried to imagine being back in the village as a child. I tried to remember what it was like to be myself again, but it was ridiculous. That life was gone. What a stupid thing to do, trying to recapture your childhood while you're being tried for killing someone. Recalling my life wouldn't make it any more real \u2013 the truth of it existed in the version being described by my lawyer. I laughed at my own stupidity. I laughed quite loudly, and couldn't stop, so I had to put my face in my hands. The lawyer turned around to look at me. She stopped speaking in the middle of a sentence and stared at me \u2013 the kind of look you give someone when you think he might be having a heart attack but you're not yet sure what's happening. The judge said, 'I don't think the defendant's life story is relevant. Please continue with your legal arguments.' My lawyer tried to dispute this, but my laughing and the judge's scolding made her lose her concentration; all the intelligence and conviction and vigour I had admired up to that point dissolved in that stuffy courtroom. It was very hot that day, the air-con wasn't working, I had trouble breathing. She stumbled over her words a couple of times, and couldn't hold her thoughts together. I was glad it was all going to end soon.\n\nShe got the details wrong. Everyone got the details wrong. Maybe you can set things straight once and for all. Is your phone recording all this? I was born in Bagan Sungai Yu, not in Kuala Selangor town as all the court documents said. The two places are separated by a sharp curve in the Selangor river, and that small distance \u2013 forty, fifty feet in places \u2013 sometimes felt like an ocean between two continents. These days, with the bridges and good tarmac roads, people think of them as just one place: Kuala Selangor. I get the papers and read articles about new seafood restaurants built on jetties over the water, I see pictures of day-trippers from KL enjoying Sunday lunch, and I think: _That's not Kuala Selangor, that's my village_. But that's the way things go: the big swallow up the small, everything becomes part of something else. It's just funny to think that when I was a child, even at primary school, we had to take the ferry over to town, or cycle miles to get around the bend in the river, and when we got to the other side, it felt so busy and important that I thought I was in Tokyo or New York. That map that you're looking at on your phone, it can't show you the real distance between our side of the river and town on the other.\n\nMy father was a fisherman, just like my grandfather before him. In fact, every man in the village was a fisherman. The country left us no choice \u2013 the river coiled around the village, blocking our route south towards the towns, forever nudging us towards the sea. On the other side were the jungle and the plantations, which offered prospects even worse than the sea. Back then it was Indians who harvested the palm oil, now it's Bangladeshis and Indonesians \u2013 whoever was doing it, we only had to look at their lives to know that their fate was worse than the storms and tides and tangle of nets that we lived with every day.\n\nAll of us worked at the mercy of the elements \u2013 the storms, floods, snakes, worms that burrow into your feet. Nature is beautiful when you look at it from afar, or from a car that passes through it with the windows rolled up. When you have to work outdoors it doesn't seem so beautiful. Yesterday I read an article on Facebook that said: _We should all spend more time outside!_ I looked at the photos of people walking in parks, hugging, drinking water from small bottles, eating slices of watermelon. Lying down on the grass without a mat, without shielding their faces from the sun. Everyone was having fun, no one was sweating or getting heat exhaustion. There were all kinds of people in the photos. Asian, African, every colour under the sun \u2013 but they were all behaving like white people. I mean, who else actually enjoys going out into the wilderness apart from these crazy _angmoh_? You get a day off work, you want to go out into the jungle? Those happy Westerners, they don't know what 'outdoors' is like around here.\n\nI remember once, when I was thirteen, fourteen \u2013 old enough to have started feeling that if I didn't escape the village I would go mad \u2013 I spent a whole day cycling as far as I could, in every direction I could think of. I went inland into the plantations in the shade of the palm-oil trees until the mud tracks got too soft for me to cycle. I looked ahead of me, thinking, How long would I have to cycle before I came out on the other side of the estate? I could only see the perfect rows of trees disappearing into the darkness, so I headed back to the coast, cycling along the dirt path that ran along the rocky shoreline, the red earth staining my toes. All the way to Sekinchan and beyond, that was all I could see: red earth, rocks and mud, the sea stretching back towards Indonesia, so flat and shallow, like a sheet of silver without end. No wind. No shade. The sun so hot on my head and arms that my skin felt stripped away with sandpaper. The light too sharp for my eyes \u2013 the same light that I'd known ever since I was a baby. I knew that all my days as an adult \u2013 every single one, to the end of my time on this earth \u2013 would be spent under that burning sun. In that moment, I suddenly got the feeling that all the things I'd ever known \u2013 my family, my home, the trees, grass, water, food, the bare earth, the huge, huge sea: everything \u2013 were strange and foreign, as if I'd never known them at all. They were mine, handed down to me at birth, the only heritage I'd ever know, and yet at that moment they didn't seem to belong to me. This land that was supposed to be part of me, and I part of it \u2013 in that instant we felt like strangers. I didn't want it. One day, it would kill me.\n\n[ _Pause; long sigh._ ]\n\nI like my life indoors now. If I had children I would make sure they never had to go outside, ever.\n\nWhat made us different from the Indians who laboured in the plantations was that we worked for ourselves. If it rained we wouldn't eat. If the catch was plentiful we could save some money and replace our worn-out shoes, buy a tarpaulin to stretch over the front yard to keep the rain out of the house \u2013 small things like that. The equation was simple for us. But they worked for the big corporations, the ones the government took over from the British. New owners, same rules. Times change but the workers' lives never improve. They had bad pay, bad housing, no schools, had to work with poisonous chemicals all day, had no entertainment in the evenings other than to drink their home-made _samsu_ that made them go blind and mad. But what else could they do? Run away to the city and live on the streets? At least back then they had papers. Now it's all Bangla and Myanmar workers \u2013 I don't think a single one of them has an ID card.\n\nWe seldom spoke about the Indians on the plantations, except to say how miserable their fate was. _Poor black devils, dead but not dead_ \u2013 repeating these kinds of expressions made us feel that by comparison we were comfortable and easy. We never mixed with them \u2013 our lives were totally separate. We didn't want anything to do with them, in case their misfortune rubbed off on us. All the time I was growing up, I shared the villagers' sense of being scared of the plantation Indians because they might infect us with their poverty, and we really didn't need any more of that in our lives. Maybe it was just another superstition that we Chinese specialise in \u2013 you know, like: Don't look at a funeral procession or you might die too. Looking back now, I guess it was because they made us realise that we were not so different from them. So they just _existed_ , a constant presence on the plantations _over there_ , which is to say right next to us \u2013 a reminder of how bad things could get.\n\nI guess you could say it was Geography's fault that I was born into a family of fishermen \u2013 that we became who we were. But history played its part too. Like most of the people in the village, three of my grandparents arrived from Indonesia in the first years of the Second World War, when it wasn't safe to be Chinese over there. They'd heard about the internment camps, the summary executions, young girls being raped \u2013 all the stuff I'm sure you've studied at college. Even I heard about that in school. They knew it might be the same story here, but they took their chances. What makes a person leave a country for another country where they could be persecuted for exactly the same thing? You get on a boat in Sumatra, cross the Melaka Straits, knowing that you could get rounded up and put in a prison camp just like you were before. Why did they do it? I'll never know. _Aiya, they made it through the war, we're all OK now, why do you care?_ That was what my mother said when I asked her about my grandparents. Stuff that went on in the war \u2013 forget it. Old Chinese folk never talk about that, so don't go asking.\n\nFor many years, my grandmother refused to register to vote. The address on her ID card was her aunt's in Teluk Intan. She'd spent a few years there when she first got to the country, and thought of it as a sort of home. She was the youngest, barely fifteen when she arrived. I'm not sure how long exactly she spent there, but the moment she got to our village she didn't move for the rest of her life. It's not like the rest of us actually bothered to vote \u2013 we didn't, or only occasionally. It would never make much difference to us \u2013 politicians change, our lives stay the same. But with my grandmother, it was more than just not caring. She actively wanted to be hidden from view. _If they come for us, they won't know where I live! I'll have one, two, three more days to escape._ That's what she used to say. _Not like the rest of you! They'll know your address and when the time comes they'll know where to find you._ Crazy old woman. People used to laugh at her. Who's going to come for us? No one cares about us or what we do! But she was convinced that one day there would be a government decree, a law that would be passed overnight, and everyone with a Chinese name would be rounded up and put in camps, just as they were during the war. Hey Po-po, just chill out! We have internet now! Facebook Twitter Insta Snapchat, can Skype with someone in Russia while listening to Super Junior on live stream, team-play video games with people that you never met in Harbin and Copenhagen. You actually believe that in this kind of world, we can just round up millions of people and put them in a prison camp, or kick them out of the country? You think you'll wake up one day and hundreds of thousands of people are going to be walking across the border into Thailand with nothing but the shirts on their backs, and all the homes and villages and entire cities we've built, with skyscrapers and malls, are going to be abandoned, just like that? Keep up with the times, Po-po!\n\nShe wouldn't listen. For the rest of her life, she was obsessed by keeping her address secret, thinking it would protect her when Chinese doomsday arrived. When she was very old \u2013 I'd long since moved out of the village but was back living in the area \u2013 she fell down one day while reaching up to pick a pomegranate from the small tree she'd planted outside her house. A scrawny plant that never grew well, no matter how much she looked after it. That was another one of her obsessions, that stupid plant; in the end, it nearly killed her. The small plastic stool she'd climbed up on to reach its branches was brittle and cracking, and couldn't take her weight when she stepped on it. She fell, broke her hip and ended up in hospital. When I arrived I found there were many forms to fill in. Each time I did so, she insisted I wrote her false address. 'What the hell is the use of doing that?' I said. 'If they need to do any follow-up tests they'll go searching for you fifty miles from where you live.'\n\n'Good,' she said. Maybe it was because she was so young when the war broke out, only fifteen, and only sixteen or seventeen when she had to get in a boat and cross the seas to Malaysia. She knew what could happen to girls of that age in times of war. I guess that's why she wanted to remain in the shadows. To be invisible is to be safe. Kids nowadays, their whole lives are on the internet \u2013 every minute of their day broadcast to the universe. Thank God my Po-po never knew Facebook \u2013 she'd have been anxious and stressed all the time. _Die lor, police see computer know where you are!_ She was the opposite \u2013 wanted her history, her entire self, to be scrubbed out from the world.\n\nThat was when I understood that for her, our village was a place of comfort. We were trapped in obscurity, hard to get in, hard to get out. If anything happened, she could just slip away into the sea. Again. It suited her just fine.\n\nMy grandparents were all originally from Fujian province. According to my calculations, the ones who came from Sumatra \u2013 they'd only been in Indonesia for ten years max before they had to move again. Imagine that \u2013 you come all the way from China, you leave behind war, famine, getting in and out of small boats drifting on the ocean for months, eventually land in some tiny town in Indonesia, find some way of earning a living, working the land or the sea. You think you own that tiny bit of scrubby jungle or marsh or wherever it is you've landed, you think you can start a family, start a new life. Then, just when your days and weeks start to feel normal, when your notion of time begins to stretch out into a year, two years, a future \u2013 when you look at the place you're in and it no longer feels as if every tree, every blade of grass is out to hurt you, you have to move again. More war, more boats, more swamps.\n\nGuess that's why they never wanted to leave the village once they got there. For them, that was it. End of the road. Stop. Don't look back. Don't look ahead. Even if this new place turned out to be as bad as the one they'd left, they'd take their chances there. No going anywhere, ever again, not even to Klang for a movie. Their children were the same \u2013 all the people of my parents' age seemed to be attached to that coastline of rocks and mangroves and driftwood, sheltered by inlets and swamps. They started to fish, firstly to feed themselves, then, after the war, to sell in the small markets down the coast. One generation handing on its work to the next \u2013 the only heirloom we had. The men out in the boats at sea, the women sewing the nets in the village, the children gutting the fish in rickety shacks perched on stilts over the muddy banks \u2013 a way of life that didn't change for nearly half a century, until the first bridge was built across the rivermouth in the early 1980s.\n\nThe other day at church I was sorting through the pile of books and magazines that people had donated \u2013 old paperbacks and textbooks dumped on a table in the hall where we have tea and cakes after mass. One of my little jobs at church is to arrange the books and empty the donations box. There's rarely much money in it. Sometimes people might take a copy of _Twilight_ , but they don't put any money in. That day someone had left a whole stack of old _Time_ magazines from 1979, 1980 \u2013 just a few years after I was born \u2013 and out of curiosity I took them home with me. I stayed up all night looking at the photos. The president of the United States was shot. _Shot!_ Can you believe that? John Lennon got shot too. Hundreds of thousands of people on the streets in Cuba. Russians fighting in Afghanistan. The whole world was changing. Our own country must have been changing. And all I could think was: How did we stay the same? The people of the village \u2013 my grandparents, my parents, even the children \u2013 we must have been trying to protect ourselves against all of the things going on around us. That's what our village meant to us: it existed to prevent us from knowing what was happening in the world. There can't have been any other explanation.\n\nBut once the bridge was built, things were different. Not long after, the businessmen from down south started building small factories around Kuala Selangor to clean and process the fish and distribute it around the country. We caught mainly white pomfret and prawns \u2013 delicate produce that required careful attention. The factories worked faster than we could, and more hygienically too, they said. That was what all the big supermarkets in the cities wanted, those giant air-conditioned spaces that were just starting to be built, so we sold them our catches cheap and let the flimsy gutting shacks fall slowly into the sea.\n\nIt was better that way, the villagers said \u2013 now at least we can save time and catch more fish, and our kids can go to school instead of cleaning fish and repairing nets with the women. But still we didn't go to school. We were supposed to, but no one really did. We turned up sometimes if we felt like it, we messed around, we cut classes, went out instead into the fields and plantations, smoked cigarettes, planned our escape from the village. Hong Kong, San Francisco \u2013 we imagined those places were just across the water, and that with a bit of cash in our pockets we could hop on a ship and start afresh there, just like our grandparents had when they'd come from Indonesia, or our ancestors who'd made it across from China a century before we were born. It seemed so easy.\n\nBut when I think back to that time, I realise that of course we didn't seriously believe we were going to end up living in America. It was just a vague idea \u2013 a longing to be some place better than where we found ourselves. Those kinds of ambitions belonged to people like you, not people like us. You know what I mean \u2013 people who lived in the cities, who went to decent schools. We were just village kids, messing around. One or two of the kids, the serious ones at school who worked hard and passed all their exams, they would only end up in a college nearby in Klang, or train to be a teacher. Keong and I and the rest of the children from the village, we didn't want that life. We wanted to be tycoons. But the funny thing was, we also _knew_ we weren't going to become tycoons. How to explain this? The more we longed for something, the more impossible it became. You only dream about things you can never obtain.\n\nWe heard about people from nearby villages moving to KL or Singapore, or going abroad to Australia or the US, and when they came back they were _rich._ We were eight, ten, twelve years old \u2013 we didn't even know what that meant, didn't know how they got rich or what they did for it, or even how much money you needed to be considered _rich_. All we knew was that they had left their homes, and now they had more than us. Sometimes they'd come back for Chinese New Year or Cheng Beng and I wouldn't even recognise them, these men and women who'd been part of my childhood. They had big new Japanese cars, Honda Accords, that sort of thing, and all the smaller kids would climb into them. I remember crawling over the seats, rubbing my face on the upholstery and sniffing the newness of it, while another kid pretended to drive the car even though he couldn't even see over the steering wheel. The very presence of such a vehicle in the village made everything else look shabby and poor. The smooth curves of the silvery body were beautiful and effortless and powerful \u2013 like a shark cutting through the water. All around it, our houses looked tired. Fragile. Concrete blocks and timber, patched up with zinc sheeting and planks of wood, every element a different colour and texture. If a storm blew through the village at that precise moment, everything else would have been swept away and only the car would have been left standing.\n\nAs I grew older and started to learn about the world, I could have asked them what they did in life, what kind of jobs they worked at, how they managed to leave the village and all that, but I never approached them. From a distance I watched them unload presents from the boot, carrying the boxes slowly into their family homes so that the rest of the village could see what they were \u2013 a colour TV, a Japanese rice cooker, a hair dryer. It wasn't just their clothes that had changed, but their voices too \u2013 not much, just a bit louder and clearer than before, with more English and Mandarin thrown into our dialect. Enough to make me feel that I couldn't communicate with them any more. Or maybe I wasn't that interested. I didn't have to go away and do what they did. I had a belief that life would improve for me, even if I didn't know how.\n\nI wasn't the only one who was optimistic. Around this time, when the new roads and factories were starting to be built, as well as the first of the new suburbs further down south with their shopping malls and car parks, everyone in the village was happy that we didn't have to gut and clean all that fish any more. We were delighted that someone else took our catch from us and cleaned it in a _processing plant_. Simply hearing that expression made us feel that we were becoming more sophisticated. We knew that we were selling the fish more cheaply than we had before, but it didn't matter. Now we could spend more time at sea. Now we could start farming cockles in the mudflats that stretched out for hundreds of yards right from our front doors. Auntie Hong found a new recipe for prawn crackers that became so famous that day-trippers came up from the city at weekends to buy them, and one day an article appeared in the national newspapers under the title 'Forgotten Seaside Charms'. I can still remember the photo of her, dressed up nicely in a red blouse, with matching lipstick and blue eyeshadow that made her look like a completely different person \u2013 who even knew that she had make-up? But there she was, proudly holding a bag of crackers in one hand, and a raw prawn in the palm of the other.\n\nFor about ten years, right up until I left the village, we got used to the excitement of the harvests of cockles \u2013 the distant sound of the shells as they were emptied from the boats into huge blue plastic tubs for cleaning. A bright sharp drumming noise that you could hear from hundreds of yards away. It was easier than going out to sea for long stretches, men and women could work together, they didn't have to be separated from their families for so long, could see the storms coming and take refuge. The children helped sort through the harvest. We picked out all the empty shells or those already half-open and dead. By the time I left the village, I knew that I would be one of the last of the children to be doing that job. Each year the harvests grew smaller, and we started to find more plastic bags in the mud that got dredged up with the catch, wrapping around the shells and suffocating them. One year I found dozens of condoms too. Maybe a factory had dumped them there, or they were carried downstream in the river \u2013 who knows. The younger kids had no idea what they were \u2013 they blew them up as though they were balloons, wore them on their fingers and clawed the air pretending to be a Pontianak or some other evil ghost. We laughed a lot that year.\n\nThen some of the kids started getting a rash on their hands \u2013 red and tender, like the raw flaking patches that follow a burn, except more itchy than painful. I was the only one who guessed that it was from the mud \u2013 some of the villagers had the same problem on their feet, from wading in the shallows during the harvest. People started visiting the Monkey God temple to make offerings and prayers. We burnt paper-money \u2013 we thought it was our fault, that we hadn't done enough to appease the heavens. Everyone said, If we were richer, we could make more donations to the temple, we'd have better catches. They didn't realise that there was nothing they could do about all the pollution flushing down the river that went right through the cities and emptied into the sea in front of our houses. Or from the offshore prawn farms that had started further up the coast where the water was deeper \u2013 you could smell the chemicals sometimes, late in the afternoon when the wind was blowing in the right direction. A sour stink, like old catpiss. Even though I wasn't good at school, I understood that all those big industries further inland which were making cars and air-conditioners and washing machines and American sneakers \u2013 they lay close to the same river that washed over our cockle beds, forty, fifty miles away, and they would just carry on emptying their waste into the river, more and more as the years went by. I didn't even feel sad, or angry \u2013 why get mad over something you can't change? That was just the way things were.\n\nThe only thing that infuriated me was that no one wanted to listen to me when I told them what I thought was happening. _Pollution_? My grandmother repeated the word as if it was some bizarre other-worldly phenomenon, like an interplanetary collision in another solar system. She turned her back on me and went to the temple. 'Don't know what they teach you in school these days.'\n\nWhenever anyone came back from the temple, they'd talk about destiny. _To live like this is our destiny_. I never thought about the meaning of fate and chance until I was in prison, and ideas just came to me during those long hours when I was lying on my bed doing nothing. What would have happened if my grandparents had landed further up the coast, or drifted south? If the winds or tides had been stronger or weaker and had carried them to Perak or Johor, or to Port Klang itself? Would I have been a dock worker or a sailor, or maybe a ship's captain? That would have been fun. If they'd landed somewhere else on the coast, where they weren't trapped between river and sea, maybe they'd have travelled inland and gone straight to a city. Maybe then, I would have become you.\n\nI'm just kidding. Of course I couldn't have become you. I know it's not that simple. And I don't mean that I want to _become_ you, or someone like you. It's just that sometimes I can't help thinking about whether I was really destined to be me.\n\n##\n\n_October 10th_\n\nThe dispute was about money, as it always is. That's why the man died. It wasn't because of a woman, as some of the papers suggested. People like us don't fight over love, we fight over houses, land, sometimes cars, mostly money \u2013 things that make a difference to the way we live.\n\nAbout five, six weeks before the night in question, I got a call at work. Hendro, one of the Indonesians who'd been working for us for some time, came running up to the edge of the water, shouting, _Boss, boss, telephone_. His head was wrapped in his usual blue-and-white bandana, his hands blackened with grease as he signalled for me to go to the office. From a distance, he looked like a superhero cartoon toy, stout and smiling, even though he'd been working since daybreak, tarring the dirt yard in front of the small office building with a few of the other guys, transforming it into a proper car park with a tarmac surface so the cars and scooters wouldn't churn up the mud in the rainy season. We were getting more and more visitors then, people coming up from KL and as far as Alor Setar to inspect the farm and witness for themselves the quality of our produce, our new filtration systems, the freshness of the water, the hygiene levels. They needed to be sure of these things before they signed supply contracts with us, so we had to impress them. We couldn't have their cars sinking into the red mud or arriving back in town looking as if they'd driven to the Sahara and back. My boss had money then, business was good.\n\nI started to make my way across the walkways, back towards the shore. I'd been supervising the release of the newest batch of hatchlings. Sea bass, that's what we were concentrating on that year, we knew the price of it would be high. There'd always been demand from Chinese restaurants, but then the upscale Western places started serving it too. A couple of our customers, who ran a neighbourhood restaurant somewhere in Petaling Jaya, showed us their menu \u2013 our fish might be selling at the same price as fancy imported produce like salmon and cod. 'You kidding me?' I said. 'Local people really paying these kinds of prices for sea bass \u2013 you sure it's not Westerners?' They assured my boss it was easy. Their clients preferred fresh local produce, they didn't want stuff that was frozen and flown all the way from Australia or Alaska. Their restaurant was just a caf\u00e9, it didn't look anything special, but it was selling sea bass fillets at fifty, sixty ringgit a serving. I thought of that money as I watched the tiny fish swim slowly out of the plastic bags, shimmering against the dark water like a bright silver cloud. A hundred bucks each on someone's plate in the city.\n\nI couldn't stop thinking about the value of those fragile little fish as I walked along the wooden planks lashed to the floating oil drums. The farm had grown in recent times, and each year we added another few pens to the existing ones \u2013 floating cages framed by timber squares on the surface that served as walkways, the nets suspended in the water below. That year, the twelfth of the farm's existence, we had grown to twenty enclosures, five of them added in the last few months alone. I liked the neatness of the grid, knew my way around it, was quick on my feet, never losing my balance even if I had to run along the narrow decks in bad weather, when the water was choppy and the wind was up. I'd stand and look down at the fish thrashing at the surface of the water as the men threw in the feed, feeling the platform bob gently under my feet as the fish disturbed the water. And I'd be happy that I no longer had to jump in to repair the netting or retrieve plastic bags and bottles and other debris that got blown in by the storms. I'd grown up by the sea, but it remained unpredictable to me, always capable of change and destruction.\n\nIt took me a while to get back to the jetty, and I thought that the caller would have hung up by then. People get fed up of waiting, especially young people \u2013 everyone is in a hurry all the time. Hendro walked to the office with me, complaining about all the work they had to do. It was just him and two other Indonesians resurfacing the car park \u2013 Budi and Joyo, who were newer, who didn't know how to operate the machinery. They were slow, he had to show them how to do everything. Hendro had to deal with one of the generators too, which had blown up the previous night and needed to be fixed by the end of the day. A cage had been ripped and needed to be mended. One of the jetties had to be repaired. Then there was the maintenance of the pens, checking the water filters, doing the feeding rounds \u2013 he was having to do it all. _They stupid, boss, they stupid_. I laughed. When I started out here at the farm, I did all that work myself. And I never complained, I just did what needed to be done. ' _Aiya_ , people these days,' I told him, 'they just like to complain about everything. _Damn migrant worker also complain, how can?_ ' We laughed. 'Get the tarmac done first, the other jobs can wait until later.'\n\nHe knew that if he did everything well and didn't cause any trouble, with all the new work we were getting, I'd make sure Mr Lai gave him some extra cash at the end of the month to send back to his wife and daughter in Java \u2013 nothing much, fifty, a hundred ringgit maybe, two hundred at Hari Raya. Sometimes, if I felt that he'd done a lot of work that month, or if we'd had a particularly difficult time with the weather or supplies, and the boss only gave him a small tip, I'd give him some extra cash from my own pocket. He'd been with us for four years, and I thought he deserved something good \u2013 it was unusual for a worker to stay that long.\n\nThe boss didn't notice all that \u2013 the physical work we did on the farm, or the men who did it. He'd started spending more and more time on the road, searching for bigger clients farther afield \u2013 his latest obsession back then was the big supermarket chains in the Klang Valley, Tesco and Carrefour and suchlike. Some weeks he didn't even show up at the farm one single day. Most days it was just me keeping an eye on the place, supervising twelve workers. It was always difficult to find good Indonesians, men who'd stick at the job and didn't steal or cheat or gamble their earnings away \u2013 that was what the boss always said, and I think that's why he could never remember their names. He didn't want to know about their lives, didn't want to think of them as real people \u2013 it was easier that way when one of them suddenly didn't turn up for work. You lose a man like that, of course you wonder what's happened to him. Maybe he'd been hit by a bus in the night while coming back from one of the brothels down near the port, or he'd died in a fight or got picked up by the police, or just decided enough was enough and headed back to Kalimantan without bothering to collect his wages.\n\nStay in the business long enough, you hear all kinds of stories about what happens to these foreign workers. Just that week, three workers from the sheet metal factory down the road went missing and were found two days later, in a shack on the edge of a plantation, their eyes bulging and bloody, their mouths gone \u2013 no more lips or tongue, just a mess of bone and blood, dissolved by acid. That's what happens with paraquat poisoning, it burns a hole in your throat \u2013 this bit here [ _touches throat, makes gurgling noise_ ] \u2013 and all the blood and whatnot comes bubbling up. One of them was a woman, a girl really, not even twenty-five years old. Who knows why they decided to commit suicide together. Workers kill themselves all the time here, and I can't say I'm surprised. I know it's wrong, it's a sin. Everyone knows that. When I started going to church that was one of the first things people told me \u2013 I guess they were concerned about my mental state, afraid I might try something stupid once I started to repent and realised what I had done, as if I hadn't realised before. _God will punish you if you commit suicide!_ Churchgoers told me that all the time. But sometimes, when you see the way these Indons and Bangladeshis live, it makes sense. [ _Pause_.] What I mean is, if there's no ceremony or leisure in your life, why would there be in death? If I worked eighteen hours a day and only had two rest days a month, and hadn't seen my family for seven years, I wouldn't be thinking of a luxury funeral with all my friends and huge bouquets of flowers and black cars the way you sometimes see in town, when some big boss dies. I wouldn't be thinking about whether my family will take out a full-page ad in the papers to announce my passing, like those Chinese tycoons do. I wouldn't be thinking about a portrait of myself dressed in a suit and tie. I'd think: it's time to go. And I'd go. No messing about.\n\nThe boss wasn't interested in all that. As long as the farm kept running well, and no one stole any money or machinery, he didn't care who worked there, how long they stayed, whether they were happy. _Ah Hock, that's why I have you!_ He used to joke that I was half-foreign \u2013 that maybe my dad had been with a prostitute, and that's why I got along with the workers so well, because I had Indon blood in me. 'Don't know how, but you actually _understand_ these guys,' he used to say. Sometimes, when clients came to visit and remarked on how smoothly things ran, the boss would tell them that it was down to me. 'My foreman does everything, makes sure the boys work well \u2013 _village boy, easier for him to communicate with them, hor._ '\n\nI was proud that he boasted about me like that. Although I grumbled from time to time about his absences, it secretly felt good to be trusted like that. I'd been working on the farm for nearly ten years, and I'd got to that point in time when one year began to resemble the next, changing in ways I could anticipate, in ways that I wished for. My salary was going up only slightly, but it was increasing all the same. I'd got used to small surprises \u2013 a nice _angpow_ at Chinese New Year from clients or machinery suppliers, sometimes a present when the boss came back from holiday, like that box of special Hokkaido wafers when he went to Japan one time.\n\nWhen life evolves like that, one small gift coming on top of another, you start to feel strong. Your salary, which surprises you at the beginning \u2013 because its regularity is astonishing, because it keeps coming to you even when you think it might stop abruptly at any moment \u2013 starts to feel as if it has always been there. An unshakeable part of the universe, like atoms or the cells in your body. You receive it month after month, one year, two years, four, eight \u2013 it can never end. You start to feel complacent, though it doesn't strike you as complacency, but a sensation of solidity that surrounds you, so thick that sometimes you wake up in the night and believe that you can reach out and touch it.\n\nPut it another way: I was thankful. I'd left home a few years before that \u2013 moved away from the village and drifted through a number of jobs in KL before returning to the area. I worked in a hardware store in Klang for a couple of months, then a shop that sold small agricultural tools and equipment just opposite the train station. I was loading some bags of fertiliser onto a customer's truck one day when I saw he had a big watch, a Rolex. This was the kind of thing that my time in KL had taught me to notice \u2013 shiny, expensive objects worn by their owners as a sort of challenge. Look at me, resist me. Covet me, reject me. I kept loading the bags, flipping each one up onto my shoulder and carrying it from the shop to the truck, fifty pounds a time, and all I could see out of the corner of my eye was the watch on the man's wrist as he stood there, hands on his hips. He checked the time. It was noon. It was hot.\n\nWhen I finished he reached into his pocket and I thought he was going to give me a tip, maybe two\u2013three ringgit, something like that, but instead he gave me his business card. 'Ever need a job, just ring me,' he said. He was called Mr Lai, and he owned a few vegetable farms near Sekinchan, some orchards, a goat farm. Plus, he was the middleman, the one who employed the groups of migrant workers to harvest the rice for the Malays who owned the biggest ricefields in the area. He arranged everything for them, got the groups of Bangladeshis and Indonesians in for the season, paid them their wages in cash, then sold the rice for the land-owners. Of course he took a cut from everything \u2013 not much, a bit here, a bit there, enough to end up a wealthy man. People make job offers all the time, but when you call them, the work isn't there any more. I'd got used to that way of living. A promise isn't a promise. Still, I kept the card.\n\nA few months later, when I had a problem with my employers \u2013 they accused me of stealing, which wasn't true, not at that job, anyway \u2013 I just turned around and walked out. The boss-lady was sitting at the desk, the cash register open, scolding me, her voice as harsh as a drill into concrete. Y _ou want the money for what, buy drugs is it? Owe money to a loan shark? What?_ Her husband stood behind her, his arms folded across the top of his paunch. Above them the clock showed nine o'clock. I could feel the sentences forming in my head, explaining that it was a mistake, that if they looked at the books again, the numbers would add up, that I wasn't the only one in charge of receiving the money. Or maybe I'd made a mistake, hadn't counted the notes properly when a big payment came in \u2013 who knows? But she was shouting too loudly, one question layered on top of another, and I couldn't keep up, the sentences in my brain never stitched together to form a clear line of defence. I wanted to scream all kinds of swear words, smash the glass cabinet in front of me with my bare fists, kick down the shelves of paint and screws and weighing scales, see all that cheap shit fall to the ground. But instead I grinned. I didn't even know I was pulling a silly cheerful face until the boss-lady said, ' _Smile what?_ Crazy boy. Where you going? Come back! Why you smiling?'\n\n'Hei.' I shook my head. _Pok kai._ I turned and walked out of the shop. I'd never liked her. She was always prying, always asking me questions about my family, where I came from \u2013 things I didn't want to talk about. _Sei pat por_. In my memory I actually called her these things to her face, told her exactly what I thought of her, but maybe I didn't. The way I'm talking now, you won't believe me, but I've never been one for saying much, especially in situations like that. She was still shouting as I left and walked out. I crossed the street and had some _bak kut teh_ at Seng Huat, just under the iron bridge by the river. Even in the shade of the huge rusty columns and the trees that stood next to them I could feel the heat of the morning sun gathering in strength, making my shirt stick to my back. All around me, office workers and old retired couples were having a quick snack before heading off to more important matters \u2013 they ate quickly, slurping their soup, not looking up at the people around them. I shared a table with a young family, a mother and two children, a boy playing his Nintendo and a small girl who looked at me and smiled as her mother read a novel. I smiled back and made a face, a big happy clown face with bulging eyes and a wide smile. Her laugh was so clear, so weightless and free, and in those few seconds I believed that I could live life exactly as I wanted, that no harm would ever come to me, not on that morning or ever after. Her mother looked up and scowled at me. She put her arm around her daughter and said, 'Don't stare at the man. Finish your food, we have to go see _ah-ma_ and _ah-gong_.'\n\nWhen they were gone, I thought, Here I am again, no job, _kaput_ , _habis_ , finished. It wasn't the first time, and it wouldn't be the last. I knew I'd find another job soon enough. If you're willing to do anything, you'll get something. But there's always that moment when you feel stuck, one door closes and all the others disappear. You can't even see them, never mind think about how to open them.\n\nI hadn't forgotten Mr Lai's card. It was still in my pocket, floppy and dog-eared from the sweat that seeped through my clothes. I found a phone booth and rang him. On the plastic dome over the telephone someone had scratched some graffiti, like some rare and delicate artwork carved in glass \u2013 the prime minister's name, followed by the word 'PANTAT'. The words had been written on the outside, and it took me some time to make out the letters in reverse. I started to laugh. Who takes the time to stand outside a phone booth and call the prime minister a cunt? That was exactly when Mr Lai answered. I tried to explain who I was, and why I was calling, but it was difficult because I was still chuckling. 'You're in a good mood,' he said. 'I like cheerful people.' A week later I was working at his fish farm near Tanjung Karang.\n\nAt first I worked as a farm hand \u2013 a labourer \u2013 repairing, lifting, transporting. There were only two cages to start with, but more were already being built, and I was soon joined by two Indonesians, Halim and Adi, then Rio, Indra, Yudianto, Satria, Bayu, Adit, Rendy, Adra, Eka. [ _Pauses._ ] Rama, Hanif, Abdi, Firman, Leo, Dimas, Denny, Fariz, Endang \u2013 they came later. After all this time I can remember all their names. Very few of them stayed for long. Six months, one year \u2013 that wasn't uncommon; a year was good, two years was unusual. Even after all the agencies started making big bucks by bringing in workers and tying them to three-year contracts, and deducting a whole year's salary from their pay packages before they even started their jobs, they'd still go missing. When you saw how hard they worked, you'd understand why. It wasn't that their spirits could not accept the wages \u2013 four, five hundred bucks a month \u2013 it was that their bodies could not tolerate the work.\n\nNot long ago I read something on Facebook that talked about minimum wages for migrant workers. I don't know how it came up on my Facebook \u2013 usually it's a lot of links to Joel Osteen videos or other devotional stuff, or badminton or soccer \u2013 but this time it was an article about how some people in KL, a human rights group or something, were trying to establish basic rights for the millions of foreigners working here. Of course they were going to fail! Even I could have told them that. They kept complaining about the lack of political will \u2013 government this, government that. What struck me and made me shake my head was all the nonsense they said about money. _Migrant wages are degrading, they humiliate the soul_. They didn't understand that it wasn't the pay that destroyed the spirits of these men and women, it was the work \u2013 the way it broke their bodies before they could even contemplate the question of salaries. The way it turned them from children to withered old creatures in the space of a few years. Anyone can work with their body like that for a year, two years, maybe even more. But when those years stretch out before you like the sea on a calm hot day, waveless, with no change or variety \u2013 when that kind of life becomes your only future, that's when you flee. Even if someone pays you ten thousand a month, your body won't accept it. Your mind tells you to stay, to earn money for your kids back home, your old parents who need help. But your body says: _Run_.\n\nThe first few months, I worked with the foreigners, sometimes even getting into the water to fix the cages with them, or carrying ten tons of sand from one end of the land to the other in wheelbarrows when we were constructing the office and other farm buildings. We wore loose-fitting shirts to protect us from the sun, but later, when the sun had gone down and we were bathing, I could see how our bodies were marked by the sun \u2013 the skin on our faces, necks and hands was three shades darker than the rest of ourselves, as if it belonged to someone else, a person less fortunate than us. I took to tying a small towel around my neck to keep the sun from burning me. I knotted it at the front, so that I could untie it easily to wipe the sweat from my face, and the men started to make fun of me. _Hey Mr Cowboy_ , they joked. _John Wayne just came to work!_\n\nOne day Mr Lai arrived and found me mixing concrete with the Indonesian labourers. I heard him shouting even before he stopped the car. He rolled down the window. 'Why you waste your time doing this kind of work? Go check the generators, check the inventory \u2013 something useful.' I stared at him, blinking. Sweat was dripping into my eyes and suddenly I felt very hot. ' _Stare what?_ Foreman also do this dirty work? Give them instructions already can, no need to join in.' The word _foreman_ stayed in my head as I washed myself in the makeshift shower we'd built in the shade of some trees. The newness of the word spun gently in my head, as clear as the sunlight that was filtering through the thin canopy of leaves above, falling around me like shards of splintered glass. Maybe there was something wrong with my eyes that day, maybe I'd been working too long in the sun.\n\nI understood that I would hold power over other human beings \u2013 that it was possible for me to impose my will on the actions of men who were just like me, whose bodies worked like mine, whose desperation and joy I not only recognised but shared. Were we friends? Of course not. I never went to their lodgings, they never came to mine. In the evenings they disappeared into the night, and I withdrew to my own space. We understood that we would never be buddies, but somehow that drew us together. Friendship is not a requirement for closeness. During the day, those long, long days under the sun and rain, we experienced pain in the same way, and satisfaction and laughter too, but mostly hardship, and that is what bound us.\n\nNow, someone had given me the right to tell these men what to do. In the space of a few seconds, we were no longer the same \u2013 perhaps we never had been, and I had been a fool to think otherwise. It sounds stupid, but all at once I did feel different from them. As I walked back to the grey concrete box that housed the office, I looked at the men shovelling sand and cement, wheeling barrowloads of hardcore, carrying sacks of grit on their shoulders. Not one of them looked up at me \u2013 they just continued in exactly the same way. It was as if they knew that something had changed, that I had detached from their world, and no longer belonged to it. I didn't know what to do. I felt like calling out to them, making a joke about Adi's permanent limp or how Bayu couldn't stop talking while he worked \u2013 the usual bad jokes that we made all the time. But it didn't feel right. A space had opened up between us, and they recognised it as much as I did. Mr Lai was nearby, walking down to the jetty, and if I'd called out to the men and joked with them, he'd have heard and said something nasty. I had no choice but to walk on.\n\nI tucked my shirt into my trousers and went into the office. All around me there were piles of papers and files containing bills, invoices. I opened a folder and stared at the words and numbers that meant nothing to me. Soon, in just a few months' time, I'd learn how to decipher what was going on, but I never completely forgot the panic that I experienced that first day. You won't understand that feeling \u2013 being powerless in front of a sheet of paper. I told myself, _It's just a stupid piece of paper_. The last time I saw so many pages of numbers or words I was at school, and that had been years ago. Even then, I'd been defeated by them \u2013 more or less flunked my SPM, even got a D in Chinese and mathematics. Only got one good grade, in history \u2013 C4 \u2013 which was a joke, because the past means nothing to me. Nothing. All across the country, probably no one failed as badly as I did. Seventeen years old, couldn't wait to leave school. Already, back then, I'd thought: damn waste of time, thank God I won't have to bother with reading and writing ever again. How would I know that I'd have to learn it all over again?\n\nI looked out at the men working in the yard, listened to the sound of the shovels against grit, the soft rumble of the cement mixer \u2013 all of it was like the rhythm of a strange music, lulling me to sleep as I sat in front of the files. The table fan was blowing in my face and making me drowsy. Wake up. Wake up. I knew that if I truly wanted to become the person I was supposed to be, I would have to make sense of those papers in front of me.\n\nI heard Mr Lai approaching, and pretended to be examining the files as he walked in. 'We have to get some parts for the generator,' I said. 'Nothing major, just one small fitting that will help us save money in the long run.' I don't know how I knew that, but I did \u2013 must have picked it up in a previous job. Mr Lai hesitated, then nodded. 'I'll give you some cash.' He was almost out of the room when he turned back and said, 'Tell you what, I'll buy a safe for the office. I'll bring over a few thousand bucks to keep in it \u2013 you can look after it for the time being.'\n\nAfter he left I sat at the desk and watched the men work. Their arms rising and falling, their legs planted deep in mounds of earth and sand, trousers rolled up to their knees. Rio was wearing a pair of fake Real Madrid shorts that were too big for him, tightened with a belt and hanging past his knees. He and Halim were hauling some bags of cement towards the mixer, walking swiftly with small steps, their bare feet making tracks in the earth. Their knees buckled slightly now and then, and I remembered that same sensation in my own legs just a couple of hours before \u2013 that feeling of forcing your body to do what it didn't want to do, until it became so familiar that you no longer knew how _not_ to force your body, and simple acts like lifting a cup of tea or a bowl of rice to your lips felt strange and lifeless. Overhead the sky was turning dark. Soon, when the afternoon rain showers arrived and turned the yard to mud, it would be more difficult to walk, and the men knew this, which is why they were pushing themselves now. Run, lift, throw. Anticipating the rain, Bayu had taken off his shirt, and I could see the dark scar on his back from his last job on a construction site in Seremban \u2013 a long curved line, the width of a finger, that looked barely healed. As he emptied a wheelbarrow full of rocks, he slipped and fell to the ground. His head hit the handle of the barrow with a dull thud, and he fell awkwardly on an outstretched hand \u2013 the kind of fall that shocks the wrist and collarbone. _Aiiiiie._ His cry was like a small child's, high-pitched and weak \u2013 it didn't match the width of his shoulders, the stockiness of his legs. The others laughed. If I'd been out there I'd have done the same \u2013 laughed and teased him for being clumsy. He rubbed his head, dusted his arm and started running with the empty wheelbarrow, ready to collect a new load. Of course he would cry out like a child. He was not even twenty years old.\n\nI sat in my chair and looked at my hands, turning them over a few times. The backs were much lighter in colour than the palms. I closed my eyes. All of a sudden, I was tired. I lay down and went to sleep, cooled by the table fan.\n\nWith each year I distanced myself a little more from the physical work on the farm. On a few occasions early on, when I was supervising a group of workers in the construction of a brick storehouse or a new net-cage, I'd get frustrated if I thought they were too slow, or weren't carrying out the task correctly \u2013 I felt the urge to jump into the boat and drag the nets up from the water to untangle them, as I'd done throughout my childhood, or to spread the mortar evenly and align the bricks myself. As I stood watching the men at work, my body felt as though it was trying to escape my control. Now, as before, I had to force it, but in a different way \u2013 this time to remain still, because it was not used to being so. The more my inaction frustrated me, the louder I shouted at the workers.\n\nStill, the body can unlearn the lessons of a lifetime, and soon the idea of taking off my shirt and working in the sun felt so foreign to me that it became distasteful. Why would I do it? I spent my time doing the rounds, making sure the fish were healthy, that the pumps and filters and generators were functioning. I also supervised all the building and repair work. The farm expanded, and after a few years we had a sales manager and a secretary.\n\nI started saving money and having a life outside of work \u2013 the kind of evenings and weekends that I'd always imagined normal people had. I got married and bought a house. We started going out of town \u2013 an overnight drive to Penang, a five-day tour of Bangkok. Even when I took time off, I drew my salary \u2013 I got used to the idea of receiving money even though I wasn't working. In August that year, I remember going to the bank and checking my account, and not even feeling any great pleasure in seeing that my pay had been safely deposited \u2013 1,900 ringgit. I had no way of knowing that it would be the last time.\n\nWhen I think back to that day when Hendro came running to tell me there was a phone call for me, I sometimes wonder how things might have been if the line had gone dead, which sometimes happened, because our connection wasn't very reliable. I know it's God's will, and that things turned out the way they did because He intended it. But still. I sometimes imagine Hendro saying, 'Someone called but said, \"Forget it, don't worry if Ah Hock is busy right now.\"' Instead, I remember his breathlessness as he walked briskly beside me, peeling off to rejoin the other men in our soon-to-be car park. In the office, the phone's receiver was lying face-down on the table, away from its cradle \u2013 I didn't know if the caller had hung up since Hendro answered it.\n\n'Hello?'\n\n' _Wai_ , little brother! It's me.'\n\n'Who are you?'\n\n'Heyyy... it's Keong.'\n\n##\n\nShe sits and stares at me without blinking.\n\nI noticed right at the start, from the very first interview. She never blinks. Not even when I run out of things to say. In moments of silence she holds my gaze and smiles. It's always me who looks away first.\n\nI didn't like her at the beginning, and part of me still doesn't trust her. You can never really believe anything they say, these educated types from the big city \u2013 they're too ready with their smile, too interested in you. She looks me in the eye when I talk, as if what I'm saying is the most important thing in the world. Every so often she nods, like she truly understands what I'm saying. Sometimes she makes a noise, like _Um... umm_ , as if to say, _Yes, I'm with you._ She frowns and looks at me as if she's absorbing every single word I say, even when I'm just talking about unimportant things \u2013 the kind of underwear I once bought in Sungai Wang Plaza, what kind of noodles I ate one evening in 2003, that kind of thing. Sometimes I do it on purpose. I want to see if she gets bored and hurries me along to talk about other stuff.\n\nBut she never loses her composure, always pretends to be fascinated. Never yawns, never checks her watch. Her Samsung Galaxy is on the table in front of me, recording everything I say, but she rarely looks at it. She just scribbles notes in her notepad from time to time. I feel like I'm a politician giving a press conference on live TV.\n\nI'm the one who keeps glancing at the phone, just to make sure it's still recording.\n\nWhen I got her first email about two months ago, I thought it was junk, like the rest of the stuff in my inbox. Beautiful China Bride, USA Diploma Online, Viagra Direct. That day I noticed a message headed _Request for interview_. I ignored it \u2013 it was as meaningless to me as all the others. About a week later, I noticed another email from the same person, headed: _Fw: Please indicate your response_. Who actually clicks on this kind of email? Every day I read about people being scammed. You click on a link and your whole computer is infected, a hacker in Russia gets all your bank info. Someone takes your hard-earned cash. They even take your identity.\n\nHowever, I am the kind of person who clicks on these links. I have no online banking, no credit card, no spouse to discover the stuff I look at on the computer \u2013 I have nothing to lose. I waited for a week, then two, reading the email a couple of times each day. Finally I thought, She's confused me with someone else.\n\nBut there was no mistake. She had been doing research for her studies in America, and had heard about my case. Now she was returning to Malaysia to spend some time conducting _field work_. She wanted to interview me, _to try to understand the circumstances and events surrounding the case_. A fraudster, I thought immediately. Someone pretending to be someone else. I'd say yes, and 'she' would come into my house with ten armed men and rob me of what little cash I had left.\n\n_I would like to talk to you on an informal basis, to build a portrait of you as a human being. I am interested in your personal history. We could have an initial chat and see how things progress._\n\nI wrote back because I was bored. She replied, with a reference letter from her university as proof. I Googled her and saw her college photo. Tan Su-Min. I asked the pastor at church to ring the number on the letter, just to be sure. New York, ah? he said. He read the letter slowly and said, doctorate in sociology \u2013 _wah_ , no joke. It's OK, it's genuine, no need to call.\n\nThe first day, she rang the bell once and opened the metal gates without waiting for me to come to the door. She had crossed the small concrete porch before I could even make it out of the kitchen. I thought, She isn't scared at all. The dog next door started barking \u2013 lots of people round here have dogs because of the break-ins. You wouldn't think there's anything to steal in a neighbourhood like this, but these days robbers do anything for a TV or a stereo set. The slightest thing that happens \u2013 a motorbike pulls up in front of a house at night \u2013 all the dogs start barking. But she wasn't at all bothered by them.\n\nShe should have been apprehensive, but instead I was the one who hesitated. I stood watching her through the grille of the front door. Hair cut short, like a boy's. Or like Faye Wong's in about 1995. (I told her this a few weeks later, when I felt comfortable enough to make jokes with her.) The same height as me, about five foot seven, wearing shorts so long they looked like army trousers, with big pockets down the side. More cheerful than in her college photo. She took off her sunglasses and put them on the top of her head.\n\nYou're OK with chatting in the house? she said. We could always go out and have our first conversation somewhere else if you're more comfortable that way. Whatever you prefer. Her question felt more like a command to me.\n\nIt's OK, we can stay here, I said.\n\nAs soon as she stepped in, she started to look around. She turned to me and tried to be polite by making small talk \u2013 _Thank you for agreeing to meet, I hope it isn't too inconvenient, isn't it hot, there's been no rain recently_ \u2013 but her eyes didn't focus on me, she kept gazing at things around the room, so often that I turned to see what she was checking out. But there was nothing there, just the same room I'd known all these years, the old rattan furniture that people from church donated. A Korean drama was playing on the TV. I'd forgotten to turn it off when she arrived, and the actors' voices filled the room. _Oppa, myo haeyo_. On the table across the room, a pile of newspapers. _Nanyang Siang Pau_ and _Sin Chew Jit Poh_. A bible. A small cookie tin that I use to put my Magnum 4D and Big Sweep tickets in. I couldn't figure out what she was looking at.\n\nI offered her a drink, as I do when people from church call round \u2013 a carton of Yeo's chrysanthemum tea. Good for hot weather, I said.\n\nShe laughed and took the carton in her hand. She looked at it as if she'd never seen one before. She took a photo of it with her phone and studied it for a while before peeling away the little straw glued to the pack. Very high sugar content, she said.\n\nHer first few questions were simple and dull. How long had I lived here, what was I planning to have for dinner that evening, was she interrupting my daily schedule \u2013 that sort of thing. I'd been nervous beforehand, wondering if she was going to ask me uncomfortable questions that I wouldn't be able to answer. Maybe I wouldn't even understand them. But all at once I felt I had nothing to fear.\n\nYes, you're interrupting _Legend of the Blue_ , I said, pointing at the TV set. She turned to look at the screen. A man and a woman sat astride horses, looking at the sky. She laughed, as if what I had said was really funny.\n\nSo you like Korean shows? she asked. I do too.\n\nI wasn't expecting that from someone like her \u2013 foreign-educated, clever. A rich girl with fancy leather sandals. I wouldn't have thought she'd watch Korean TV. I started talking about the things I watch to fill my days, about _Scarlet Heart_ and _Descendants of the Sun_ , and also my favourite series from previous years, like _Secret Garden_ and _Moon Embracing the Sun_. I told her about the time a couple of years back when I had spent a whole evening drinking beer and eating fried chicken wings while watching _My Love From the Star_ just to feel in tune with Jun Ji-Hyun's character in the show, and that I'd loved my _chimek_ -and-TV night so much that I had another the next day, with more beer and wings and Korean romance, right up until the street lamps went off and the skies began to lighten. When the church group called round that morning they were shocked to find me surrounded by beer bottles and looking a bit sick. They thought I was slipping back into bad ways, so they made me go to church with them to see the pastor, who talked to me about how the devil can get inside me without my even knowing it. If I wasn't vigilant at all times, and didn't pray for God's protection, I would be vulnerable, and though I felt sorry and knew what he said was true, I also knew that I wouldn't stop watching Korean shows. I would just stop the beer \u2013 it was too expensive anyway.\n\nAll that time she was nodding in agreement, occasionally laughing \u2013 a soft giggle that encouraged me to talk even more. She scribbled some words on a notepad now and then, and set her phone down on the table, recording.\n\nBut I'm just talking rubbish, I said.\n\nNo, no \u2013 it's _really_ interesting. Please, go on.\n\nAs I spoke I couldn't stop wondering why she was so interested in me. But I couldn't stop talking. What's more, to a total stranger. The way she nodded and silently wrote her notes made me feel both important and uneasy. Sometimes she would say something simple like _Those situations must have been difficult for you_ , and those few words were like a match to a trail of gasoline, lighting up a path ahead, making me talk even more. I tried to resist the impulse to speak, but failed. What revelations would I make, and regret later? I liked her for letting me talk. I hated her for making me talk.\n\nShe spoke Mandarin in a way that made it obvious that it was a second language to her \u2013 sometimes clear as a textbook, other times halting, mixed in with a bunch of English words. Everything about her seemed alien to me that first time, even though she came from only thirty miles away. Her foreignness made it easier for me to speak as freely as I did. I could tell her anything I wanted, and she would have to believe me. That first day, even though I tried to be formal in the way I spoke, I felt myself lapsing into dialects, my country Hokkien surging out of me from time to time, or else the odd Cantonese swear word popping up before I even realised I'd said it.\n\nSuddenly I would be aware of my speech, the difference between the crudeness of my voice and the polish of hers, always under control, never too loud or too soft. Sometimes I would say something inappropriate and I'd think, Now she is going to realise she has made a huge mistake. Now she will start making excuses to leave. But her expression never changed \u2013 always balanced between interest and amusement. She stayed for four hours.\n\nWe've seen each other once or twice a week, sometimes three times, for the last two months. Every time, without fail, she comes to my house and sits patiently while I talk. We drink Chinese tea or chrysanthemum tea from a carton, and I might snack on some biscuits. She never eats anything, not even a dried melon seed. If a stranger walked into the room they would see a couple of acquaintances, or perhaps relatives \u2013 a young woman dutifully listening to her older cousin. But they are not as intimate as it appears. They are separated not just by ten or fifteen years, but by something else that neither can properly identify.\n\nFor example, how do you explain this incident? One day, not long after we first meet, maybe four or five sessions in, I'm talking about random, unconnected incidents from my childhood \u2013 from the time we were living with my uncle, after my father had left us and we had nowhere to call our own. I was only ten, but I hated that house. I spent all day outdoors, walking along the streams and inlets that ran into the river and eventually fed into the sea. I knew all the ricefields and the forests, I knew how to set traps for fish and shoot birds with my catapult. Sometimes the birds I shot wouldn't be killed, they would just fall to the ground and flap around weakly with broken wings. Sometimes I felt pity for them, and regretted hurting them, but even as I felt that sorrow I knew I would do it again. The only way I could stop their suffering was to kill them, usually by dropping a big rock on them, or by twisting their necks \u2013 just like _this_ , I show her with my hands.\n\nShe nods and continues to take notes, but I notice something \u2013 a tiny change in her expression, something like a grimace that breaks through her half-smile, just for a moment, before she composes herself. So I continue. I describe how I would hear a soft crunch under the rock as I dropped it on the bird. How their bones were weaker than twigs in my hands. She nods, as if she understands, but I know she has no idea what it means to put an end to a life.\n\nShe has no idea what I felt, at that moment or any other.\n\nI begin to tell her about the cat, the small black-and-white kitten, that I found by the side of the road one day. It had been injured, its hind legs broken and bloody. It was squealing loudly, and for a second I thought maybe I should take it home as a pet. I would heal it, give it some medicine and fix its legs. But I knew that it was hopeless, it was too weak to survive. It would not even last the journey home. As I picked up the rock I thought, I'm sorry, but this is the way life is. In this world, some of us are strong, others are weak. Some will live, others will flourish, all will die. I wanted to feel pity, but I didn't. I brought the rock down hard on its head. Then I lifted it again, trying not to look at the black-red mess staining the hard earth. I hit it with the rock another time, harder, to make sure the cat was no longer suffering.\n\nShe continues to look down at her notebook, but she has stopped scribbling \u2013 her pen is poised over the page, waiting. Her jaw hardens, twitching slightly on the right side. For once, she does not look at me, but focuses on her notes. At last she smiles again, but her brow is still tight \u2013 the corners of her eyes a little creased. She says, Umm, but then she has to clear her throat. As if she's going to cough, only she doesn't.\n\nToday is a normal day, meaning we're relaxed, and conversation is easy. I don't have much to say of interest, but that's OK. She doesn't mind if I ramble. We have a couple of moments' silence, but nothing that lasts too long. We don't have any of those awkward pauses we used to have in the early sessions, when I sometimes felt like fleeing the room. I'm talking about all the things I intend to do if I strike it big on the lottery one day. Maybe go travelling. Maybe get some training on computers. She's smiling while she writes in her notebook. She raises her eyebrows as if to say, _That's a great idea._\n\nBut as I'm talking, something comes to mind, as it sometimes does when I'm with her. I remember the look on her face after I told her about the cat \u2013 her lips pulled into a smile, but her eyes narrowed, accusing me of something. But what? I don't know what to call the look on her face. I don't know if I can call it anger, or contempt, or sadness.\n\nAnd I can't stop the thought from forming in my head: she cares more about the cat than she does about me.\n\n##\n\n_October 13th_\n\nThe first time I ever saw Keong, he was beating up another kid. The boy's lip was puffy and split, and there was a trail of rich red blood down his T-shirt, matched in colour by two angry marks on his leg, parallel straight lines that ran from knee to ankle. He was half-sitting, half-crouching on the floor \u2013 Keong was gripping him by his wrist with one hand, and in the other he was holding a stick, about three feet long. They both looked up when they saw me in the doorway. A pause. Then Keong delivered another blow, and another, as if I hadn't appeared at all \u2013 as if the sight of me had been an illusion, a trick of the light. I didn't know what offence the other kid had committed to deserve the beating \u2013 what form the insult had taken. Later, I learned that it didn't take much for Keong to feel insulted.\n\nThe fight, which I guess you would probably say was an _assault_ , was taking place in a disused shack on the edge of an inlet where the smaller boats were moored, sheltered from the storms that blew in from the open waters. The tide had gone out, and I was picking my way through the mangroves, hoping to dig out a crab from the mud \u2013 just killing time, as usual. I was twelve, I spent all day outdoors. I heard a quick suffocated groan, someone who wanted to cry out but didn't \u2013 the scream squeezed in the throat so that when it emerged it was only a weak impression of the noise it should have been. I recognised pain in that fleeting sound, which most people wouldn't even have noticed \u2013 I'd heard it many times in my own family \u2013 and instantly I knew where it had come from. The shack had once been used for storing nets and jerry cans, but it had been cleared out when our smaller boats started to become superfluous with the arrival of the large vessels capable of fishing over a much further range. Parts of it had rotted and fallen into the mud below, joining the skeletons of wooden boats that we'd simply abandoned over the years.\n\nI stood in the doorway for a few minutes, watching until Keong had finished with the boy. I didn't try to help the victim or intervene. That was how things worked in the world, in our world at least \u2013 we didn't get mixed up in other people's troubles. Keong brushed past me as he walked out into the bright sunlight. I still had the feeling that he hadn't noticed me, but a few moments later he turned back and said, 'Come with me.' Now I realise that it wasn't a command but a question, but at that time it didn't seem as if I had a choice. As I walked with him back towards the village, I thought about the boy lying on the broken floor of the broken hut \u2013 his body broken too, defeated. I wondered if I should go back, try and help him. I didn't want him to be alone. I could have gathered the other boys in the village and reported what I'd witnessed. But instead I continued walking with Keong.\n\nNowadays I realise that it was only natural that our relationship would end up being what it was. What is born out of violence ends in violence.\n\nHis family had recently moved into a place on the edge of the village, where the houses began to thin out, overwhelmed by the mangrove forests and patchy orchards struggling to thrive in the salt-soaked earth. He was only four or five years older than me, but already belonged to a different world, one I had heard and dreamed about but didn't yet recognise, didn't yet know was even real \u2013 it was only just starting to draw into focus in my imagination, and it was Keong who made it real. I'm talking about the city \u2013 I don't mean Klang, which was thirty, thirty-five miles away, but Kuala Lumpur, only another ten, fifteen miles further. I'm not sure exactly, I just know that it's the biggest fifty-mile gap you could think of.\n\nKeong had just moved down from there, and couldn't wait to return. His mother was from these parts \u2013 Kuala Selangor, I think \u2013 but had moved up to KL to find work. She'd got married, given birth to Keong, but then things started to get tough. Eventually she got divorced, and soon she was struggling. A young woman with a fourteen-year-old kid on her hands \u2013 you don't need a PhD to figure out it's a bad situation that's only going to get worse. A Chinese boy in the city with no money and no parents to keep him in check \u2013 they only do one thing. Join a gang.\n\nIt wasn't long after his parents got divorced that Keong started cutting class \u2013 a couple of lessons here, a half-day there, then whole days and even entire weeks. He might as well have quit school completely. He told me how he'd once strolled into class late, in the middle of the lesson, while the teacher was explaining how the earth's land masses are built on continental plates that are constantly shifting and pushing against each other \u2013 he remembered the neat picture she was drawing on the board, remembered thinking, _Maybe I should just pick up a piece of chalk and mess it up right now._ She was so shocked by how cool and brazen he was, sauntering in halfway through class, that she just stopped talking, her mouth hanging open. Didn't dare challenge him, didn't say a word. After a few seconds she went back to her diagram, and pretended not to notice when he put his feet up on his desk and rubbed his cock through his trousers as if to say, _Fuck this, I'm bored_. By then, she knew he was a gangster \u2013 a small-time gangster but a real one nonetheless, not just a bully who acted tough. His dyed coppery hair, the rings he wore \u2013 those were signs of someone you wanted to avoid. There were stories of what these boys did, even at fifteen, sixteen \u2013 stories of teachers being beaten up at the school gates, of a mean sonofabitch headmaster taking on a young tough guy and giving him a public caning at morning assembly, and the next day finding his car on fire. A giant ball of flames and black smoke that you could see five miles away. Bang. Three years' salary, gone.\n\nOne day he walks in and blows a kiss at the teacher. She knows all about him, knows his reputation, so she ignores him. She knows that he does this all the time: strolls in late, puts his feet on the desk, rubs his crotch, makes loud comments that distract the other boys. She says nothing. _The only volcanic pressure I know is right here_ , he says loudly, pointing between his legs. The other boys laugh, throw scrunched-up paper balls at each other. Still the teacher says nothing; she carries on talking, through the laughter and disruption. When the boys have calmed down, Keong takes out a pack of Salems, carefully puts one between his lips and closes his eyes, as if he's taking a nap. Waits for a reprimand, but the teacher says nothing. Maybe she doesn't care \u2013 why would she care about him? Then he takes out a lighter \u2013 its flame is blue and dances like a demon as he lights his cigarette and takes a deep, deep drag. He sees the teacher staring at him through the cloud of silver smoke. _Ooooooohhhh_. The other boys' low moan is both a sign of respect and a challenge \u2013 respect for him, challenge for the teacher. Still she says nothing. She stands staring at the class, piece of chalk in hand, then walks out the door. (Crying \u2013 she was crying! Keong laughed as he told me this story.) A couple of weeks later, Keong is expelled from school. No big deal, he thinks. I was going to drop out soon anyway.\n\nFacing his mum is another matter. Every morning, even after he is expelled, he puts on his uniform and pretends he's going to school. He has his rucksack with him, slung over one shoulder, trying to look serious. His mother asks him how things are going at school, and he says, OK, not so bad. Maths is fine, I like maths. Geography is fun too. He means it, too, because \u2013 here's the thing \u2013 he thinks more about class and about his lessons now that he has been expelled than he ever did when he was at school. When his mother smiles and says, 'Good boy. Education is your future. Study hard so that you don't end up like me,' he feels a sudden quickening of his pulse, the guilt cutting at his insides like the knife he has started to carry around for the gang fights that he will very soon get involved in.\n\n(At this precise point in time his mother is between jobs. Every morning she goes out in search of work, every day she comes back with nothing to show but a promise of work that never comes true. This lasts about a month, until she becomes a shampoo girl at a salon in Cheras called Angelique D'Style.)\n\nHe decides to get some cash. It's the only way to relieve his guilt. (This is my analysis of his situation, not his \u2013 he never talked much about things like _guilt_ or _obligation_.) By this time he's hanging around with boys who are nineteen, twenty, even a bit older. They've been running businesses for a few years, selling fake DVDs, small electronics \u2013 you know the type. Their friends and associates own stalls all over the city, Chow Kit Road, Low Yat Plaza, the top floor of Sungai Wang, you name it. But mainly their money comes from drugs \u2013 the boys are low-level dealers. _Syabu_ , _fengtau_ , _ice_ , _G_ , _K_ \u2013 whatever name it goes by, they sell it.\n\nYou're looking at me like you don't know what all that is. Amphetamines, in all their forms, streaming over the border from Laos and Thailand. There would have been harder, more expensive stuff floating around too, heroin and coke I guess, but Keong and his friends wouldn't have got their hands on that kind of junk so often, if ever at all. He's still a kid, remember, barely sixteen. The cash he makes is small change for a serious dealer. Most of the time he just sits at the front of a cramped stall in Bukit Bintang selling portable electronics, Discmans, VCR players, Nintendo \u2013 the sort of thing every other stall in the area seems to sell. Every so often someone asks him for some pills, and he casually walks over to another stall fifty yards away, and after a few minutes one of his friends will come over with a small packet. Sometimes he's the runner, carrying a plastic sachet from one place to another. He's young enough for the police to ignore.\n\nStill, the money he makes allows him to buy new clothes, the kind all the young gangsters favour \u2013 'carrot-cut' trousers, baggy around the ass and clinging tightly to the ankles, shirts with sharp shoulders, a small diamond stud in his left ear. He wants to look like Alan Tam Wing-Lun or one of the other Hong Kong singing superstars. He does look like Alan Tam! That's what he thinks. But really \u2013 even I could see it when he proudly showed me photos of him and his _heng tai_ , who were not really his brothers in any sense of the word, because they wouldn't come to his aid when he needed them \u2013 he ends up with the look that his teachers at school would identify as _samseng_ or _Ah Beng_. Boys who will soon quit school and become stallholders or _dim sum_ waiters on the outside, petty gangsters on the inside.\n\nOne evening Keong is delivering some bundles of cash to a building in Jalan Pudu \u2013 he doesn't know who or what the money's for. He's just been given the address, which he's committed to memory so he doesn't have to write it on his palm like he did the last time. _Sor hai, no brain, meh?_ his friends had teased him (how innocent and stupid he'd been!). He's only delivering a thousand ringgit, hardly enough to buy a decent second-hand scooter, but still, not worth taking the risk. Not that Keong recognises much risk \u2013 he feels invincible these days, with his band of brothers and cash in his pocket. It comes as a surprise when two police motorbikes pull up ahead of him \u2013 big powerful white bikes, surprisingly quiet, unlike the noisy scooters that his friends ride. He assumes they've stopped for someone else, or are just taking a break for an early-evening drink, but instead they walk swiftly towards him, backing him up against the wall. He doesn't care, he acts tough. Why you stopping me? he says, somewhat aggressively, which only inflames them further. You got warrant? No warrant cannot arrest. Why? Because I'm Chinese is it? They push him against the wall, take off his backpack and find the money, neatly bound by rubber bands in tight little stacks. When they take them out, they look like small bricks.\n\nChinese kid with a load of cash in his bag \u2013 no further explanation needed. _Samseng_. They slap him round the head.\n\nStill, he is proud, unrepentant. At the police station he sits in a cell waiting for his brothers to turn up, maybe even the legendary ultimate big boss, who he knows by reputation but has never met, the one people say is best friends with the inspector general of police. After he's been there a day, then two, he realises that he's been forgotten. Even the police who patrol the cells seem barely to notice his presence. They give him water and rice with sambal \u2013 no egg or chicken or anything \u2013 that he eats quickly because he's so hungry, but it makes him sick, gives him terrible diarrhoea that lasts for a whole day, so when they finally let him out it's obvious that it's only because he was stinking up his cell too much. Even the two Indonesians in the lock-up were complaining about how disgusting it smelled.\n\nIn the end it wasn't his brush with the police that ended his brief career as a gangster, it was his mother. He'd thought she'd be happy with the money he gave her from time to time, that even if she suspected what he was doing to earn it, she'd turn a blind eye because they needed it so much. Now she could pay the electricity bill. Now she could buy some herbs to make chicken soup to give herself strength for work. Twice he'd bought her a blouse from Petaling Street because he wanted her to have new clothes to wear to work, but she made a point of never putting them on \u2013 and it hurt him to see how these gifts disgusted her. He'd thought she would be happy, but she just accepted whatever money he gave her without expressing gratitude. She looked away each time he handed it to her, the notes folded up so she couldn't see exactly how much it was. 'Being a part-time waiter pays well these days,' was all she said. And then, one Sunday when they were both at home watching TV, she said, 'I had a craving for noodles yesterday after work, so I went to Wanchai Noodle House. Asked if you were working there that day.'\n\nKeong waited for her to say, 'They told me they didn't know anyone by that name.' Waited for the embarrassment and guilt and anger, wondered for a second how he should react, whether to be confrontational, scream at her, smash the furniture, set something on fire \u2013 anything to deal with the pain. But she said nothing more, just continued watching TV silently.\n\nTwo weeks later they were down here, living in our village.\n\nWhat a shithole.\n\nHis mother had found a job in a factory processing fish \u2013 gutting and scaling them and packaging them for delivery to supermarkets. My mother had once worked in that factory too. It was new, it wasn't so bad. Her hours were long but regular, her salary small but regular. She'd been born in the area, spent her whole life until the age of twenty-two in Tanjung Karang, just up the coast. A relative had told her about a house that had become vacant in Bagan Sungai Yu, two bedrooms, a big front room, a kitchen \u2013 just right for a woman, not young, not old, and her son, no longer a child but years away from becoming a man. It was a bit out of the way, but she didn't mind, she had a scooter and Keong could cycle into town if he needed to. There were bridges across the river now, it wasn't so hard to get around. She didn't know what they'd do, she didn't have a plan \u2013 she just knew she had to move back to these parts and stay for as long as she could.\n\nShe still had family up the road, an aunt and an uncle, two cousins, and that seemed plenty. She could call them and get together for dinner once in a while \u2013 it wasn't a fancy life, but it felt as if it would never change much, in fact hadn't changed much since she'd left two decades before. What she'd hated back then, she now loved: the sense of continuity, of surrendering to something stronger than her \u2013 the pulling in of her horizons, the comfort to be found in the death of ambition. She had forgotten what it was that she'd wanted to accomplish when she'd left home for the city, but whatever that dream was, it had caused too much anxiety and pushed her towards bad decisions. Now it was gone, she could start to live again. Years later, I would recognise the same feeling, and I would think of her, this round-faced woman who said little but smiled a lot, her cheeks pulled into small dimples. Auntie Chai. She always asked me to come round for some biscuits and a cold drink whenever our paths crossed, but somehow it rarely happened, even in a village as small as ours.\n\nOnly problem for her was Keong. Almost seventeen, bored out of his mind, he despised every minute of his life here, resented being dragged away from KL, where he had felt strong and grown-up. He hated the way his mother had tricked him into moving here \u2013 she'd told him that they were visiting relatives for Cheng Beng, that they'd only be gone a week, long enough to tidy the graves and say hello to a couple of distant cousins. They had to pack everything because she was giving up the lease of their apartment in KL, but would be getting a new one when they came back. How could he have been so dumb? He should have just insisted on staying put when he found out \u2013 he could easily have made his own way in life. But what else, really, could he do? A mother is a mother. If he'd stayed in KL, chances are he'd never have seen his mother again.\n\nThe eighteen months he lived in the village were the longest of his life. 'If I'm still here when I'm twenty, I'll kill myself. Swear to Buddha, Goddess of Mercy, every damn deity you can think of. I'll do it.'\n\nThe other kids in the village stayed away from him. When he passed them in the road he just looked straight ahead, didn't stop to say hello. They didn't like outsiders, and he could tell that they weren't going to accept him as one of them \u2013 which was just fine, because he didn't have anything to say to them either. 'Me and you \u2013 you guys, I mean, all of you \u2013 we got nothing in common. I don't know anything about digging prawns from the mud,' he told me.\n\n'But prawns don't live in the mud.'\n\n'Then why are you sea gypsies always picking through the mud as if it's the most interesting thing in your life?'\n\nUp to then, I'd never questioned our relationship with the mudflats \u2013 our whole life by the sea \u2013 but all of a sudden this image of us crouching anxiously in the sticky grey muck seemed ridiculous. Why would anyone want to spend their days sifting through the mud for shellfish that sell for a few bucks per kilo?\n\n'I don't even like the sight of you,' he once said, laughing. 'Don't you guys have anything to wear other than rags?' He continued to wear his city clothes, real shirts with long sleeves buttoned at the wrist, but his copper highlights had faded, and his hair was now just as black as everyone else's, distinguished only by the long locks that fell over his forehead \u2013 a style that the other boys secretly made fun of. He sneered at us, we laughed at him. Sometimes, when I remember how he looked and spoke in court when testifying at my trial \u2013 how different he had become from me \u2013 I think back to his early days in the village, and realise that I should have known there would always be an unbridgeable distance between us. We both should have known that. But at that age, how could we?\n\nIt was only at games \u2013 on the small dirt patch that passed for a soccer pitch, and the basketball court that the temple had donated to the village \u2013 that the other kids had any real contact with him. Keong watched from the sidelines for a couple of weeks, smoking and pretending not to be interested. Then one day, during one of our daily late-afternoon games, just casually shooting hoops without really meaning to play \u2013 we were tired from school and from working with the nets and the cockles \u2013 the ball rolled out of play, directly into Keong's hands. He took a shot, a long graceful arc of the arms, surprising for a kid as skinny as him. He missed, but then, as if to atone for his mistake, stubbed out his cigarette and jogged towards us, waving his hands to receive the ball.\n\nDuring that first match, and every subsequent one, Keong's entry was a sign that things were about to turn rough. He hustled for every ball, elbows jabbing, bumping into you just to let you know he was there. It wasn't the way we usually played, and when he wasn't there we were as lethargic and half-hearted as ever. Keong made us forget the heat and the fatigue \u2013 he made us want to fight. He put his hands in our faces, scratching our arms, inviting a punch-up, which he duly got. Once, a boy older and taller than him squared up to him, and when Keong spat at him, the boy threw a punch that floored Keong, to the laughter of the others. The next day at soccer, the same boy slid into a tackle, bringing Keong down face-first into the dirt. This time Keong was prepared. He had a rock in his pocket, which he held tightly in his fist as he swung at the boy's head. It was the dry season, and the blood marked the earth for many days afterwards.\n\nOn other occasions, the smallest insult would ensure that Keong stopped dead in his tracks. He'd stand still and walk towards whoever had offended him, fists clenched. It could be anything, whispered words that didn't mean a thing \u2013 _lia ma_ , _cheebye_ , really, just meaningless expressions \u2013 but Keong would always react in the same way, throwing the first punch, launching himself with the full force of his scrawny body at whoever had muttered the passing vulgarity. I'm not sure why they continued to insult him. He lived in a house at the farthest end of the village, and didn't go to school, so they had little contact with him. Maybe it was simply that he wasn't one of us. Or maybe that without knowing it, we were bored by the regularity of our lives \u2013 scared by the way our fate was determined by the weather and the tides, the way the slightest change in the moon's position could mean that we would have little to eat for the next month. With Keong, the equation was so much simpler. Call him a bad name and he'd react in exactly the same way every time. I never understood why he kept turning up at our games, when he knew it would always end in a fight. I guess he needed to do that to remind himself that he would never belong in our village \u2013 that he was hated there, and had a good reason to get the hell out of the place.\n\nThat I became his only friend in the village was not a surprise. He never expressed any gratitude for my silence over his beating up of the boy, but I knew he was thankful that I hadn't caused any further trouble for him. I wanted to explain that it wasn't because I cared about his welfare that I didn't snitch on him, it was just because I didn't want to get involved in anything messy. I was always like that, even as a kid. But somehow, at that age, explanations don't come easily, and don't seem necessary either, so the episode became anchored in the depths of our shared history, never talked about, but never forgotten either. It was the same in the days and weeks following the killing, when I was waiting for the police, for someone, anyone, to discover what I'd done. I didn't know when or how it would happen. I was scared of life's sudden uncertainty, but I was sure of one thing: that Keong would not tell anyone about the incident. If no one else found out, that terrible act would be silently swallowed up by our past.\n\nHe and his mother were my closest neighbours \u2013 the first people we saw when I cycled into the village. At that point we were living in our own house about a mile away from the village proper, and at night I could just about make out the lights of their house from across the fields. Physically separated from the rest of the village, it was easier for us to strike up a friendship that went unnoticed by the others, who found Keong's urban manners unnatural and ridiculous \u2013 his cowboy swagger, arms and shoulders swaying, his constant chatter, always comparing things in the village unfavourably to what he had experienced before. I knew he was an idiot too, but I couldn't resist his stories of life in the city, even though I suspected that they were exaggerated, and maybe plain untrue. Being with Keong and listening to his tales of fights in alleyways behind shopping malls, or making so much money you couldn't fit it all into your pockets, was like watching a movie that enveloped me completely, that made me feel I could be part of the action if I wanted to, even when I knew it was made up. Just reach out and I could touch that world. Just hop on a bus and I could be living in it. The more I lapped up his accounts of his life, the more he talked, spinning ever more outrageous tales. _Your mother, of course it's all true!_ He needed me to be his audience even more than I needed to be entertained by him \u2013 without me, his memories of the city would have shrivelled and dried in the salt and sun of our coastal village. We all have our own way of surviving, and telling stories was his.\n\nHe got work up the coast as a waiter in a seafood restaurant in Sekinchan, one of those big noisy places perched on stilts that rise up over the mudflats, popular with day-trippers from the city. He didn't like taking orders from everyone, being shouted at by the boss and the customers, but he put up with it for a time because he liked seeing the people from KL, who reminded him of his life back there \u2013 his real life, not the temporary hell that he was enduring. He chatted to them as he cleared away the dishes, found that he carried himself differently; and he realised, shockingly, that in just a few months he'd started to shuffle lazily like a village boy, instead of swaggering like he used to. How could he have changed so much in such a short time? 'Hey, what's up?' he'd say as he approached a table of tourists from KL to take their order. He could see in the way their eyes widened slightly before they broke into a smile that they were surprised to find someone like him at a restaurant like that, way out in the country. In the briskness of his voice and the sharpness of his speech they saw him as one of them, and in their recognition of him, he finally understood himself.\n\nBest of all were the girls. That's really why he stayed in the job \u2013 the discreet eye contact, the smiles, the fact that he knew \u2013 he knew! \u2013 that they found him cool, these sophisticated women from the suburbs of the capital. One time an entire table of young women arrived for lunch on a Sunday, eight of them, without a single guy in sight, can you imagine that? What a chance for Keong. He was all over them, buzzing round the table like a wasp, never settling for long \u2013 taking their orders, bringing them a glass of warm boiled water even when they didn't ask for it, offering them extra dishes of groundnuts behind the boss's back, slipping in a casual compliment here and there, like, ' _Wah_ , nice handbag,' and even encouraging them when they ordered Tiger beer and started to get a bit noisy. ' _No need to be so traditional hor_. Women should have an independent life, not just with their husbands all the time!' He knew what city folk liked to hear \u2013 the kind of expressions I would never really be able to use convincingly, no matter how I tried \u2013 and loved communicating with them. At last he could speak to people who understood him, instead of these country idiots with their lazy tongues and plodding minds. Sometimes, as with that group of women, he would strike up such a bond with the customers that they'd start calling him by his name whenever they wanted anything, and for those few hours he'd feel as though he had friends.\n\nHe wrote his name on a restaurant card and gave it to one of the women who had smiled at him in a way that suggested she had appreciated more than just his hard work that day. He was sure of it! 'Anytime you come back, just ask for me and I'll get you a nice table, right on the water's edge.' She gave him her business card, said she was always looking for new employees, though she never said what her business was. He kept the card for months, waiting for the right moment to call, but when he finally did, the number was dead. I was with him when he rang from the phone booth outside the post office in Kuala Selangor town. Three, four times at least, before he gave up. 'Ah Hock, you try,' he said, handing me the receiver. I put a coin in the phone and carefully dialled the number. The funny thing was that I didn't hear any message saying that the number was out of use, or even a flat continuous tone, like the one in movies when someone dies in hospital \u2013 when you know for sure that there is no more hope. There was just a silence, an emptiness so vast it could have stretched forever.\n\nAs I stood there with the receiver pressed tightly to my ear, I watched Keong sitting on the stone kerb, absently plucking the long grass that was growing next to him, throwing it into the air. He seemed to have shrunk in the eighteen months he'd spent in the village \u2013 or maybe it was just that I'd got bigger. There were rain clouds out at sea that were threatening to blow inland, and a sudden breeze troubled the tops of the trees. I got tired of waiting and hung up, but as we cycled home the silence on the phone seemed to be replaced by an even greater void. Neither of us spoke. Maybe it was the approaching storm, which made the air feel sticky, too heavy to breathe \u2013 and this in turn made time stretch out before us, endless and frightening.\n\nNot long afterwards, Keong left the village and headed back to KL. I thought I'd never see him again, but a few years later I felt the same urge to leave that others before me had experienced \u2013 the restlessness that affects boys and girls alike when they reach a certain age and can't stop thinking about being somewhere else. It was like an ailment, a virus that I always thought I would be immune to, but there I was, just like everyone else, desperate to escape. I went to Keong's mother's house and got his number. When I went to the phone booth to call him, he answered after just a few seconds.\n\nThis was in 1996 \u2013 the last months of my teenage years.\n\n##\n\nShe stares at the plate as if she's trying to work out what's on it, even though it's obvious.\n\nIt's _chee cheong fun_ , I say. Early lunch.\n\nI know.\n\nHave some. I bought enough for both of us.\n\nNo, it's fine, I'm not hungry.\n\n_Hei_ , don't be so polite. Have some. It's from Long Kei, you know, just down the road in Taman Eng Ann. The best in town. I went specially.\n\nReally, that's kind of you, but I'm not hungry.\n\nYou need to eat! You're too skinny.\n\nI start to dish out a portion for her, and she slowly sits down in front of it. She looks sad as she stares at the plate.\n\nI promise you, it's delicious. They make their _tau pan jeong_ fresh every day.\n\nIt's not that.\n\nWhat's the problem then?\n\nI don't eat carbohydrates. Well, not at the moment, anyway.\n\n_Carbohydrates_?\n\nYeah. Noodles, bread, potatoes, rice, anything like that.\n\nNot even rice?\n\nNo.\n\nMy God. Not a good idea! That's why you're so thin.\n\nIt's fine, it's not a big deal. I can eat some with you.\n\nThe way she says it makes me feel bad for insisting. Maybe it's a religious ritual that I don't know about, a Buddhist tradition. She cuts off a piece the size of her fingernail and puts it in her mouth. I wait nervously.\n\nMmm. It's good.\n\nI told you! _Ha_ , eat \u2013 eat some more.\n\nWait, she says. Is there meat in the sauce?\n\nDon't think so.\n\n_Shit_ , I think. She's a Buddhist.\n\nYou know what, I really appreciate this, but I had a really big breakfast before I came.\n\nNo rice or noodles or bread \u2013 how can you have had a big breakfast?\n\nWhy don't you take your time and finish your _chee cheong fun_? I'll sit and look over my notes, and when you're ready, you just let me know and we can begin the interview for today.\n\nOK.\n\nI try and take my time eating, enjoying every morsel of the noodles as I usually do. But even though I don't look at her, I can see her out of the corner of my eye, sitting in the rattan armchair, looking through pieces of paper in her folder. She isn't doing anything in particular. She doesn't look at me or try to talk to me, she just looks at her notes, turning the pages over, rearranging them. I try to ignore her and concentrate on my food, but it's impossible. I eat quickly, then take my usual seat opposite her.\n\nShe looks up and smiles. Shall we begin?\n\n##\n\n_October 15th_\n\nBottled-gas delivery man.\n\nWaiter, several times.\n\nNight security guard.\n\nStrange. I'm trying to remember all the jobs I did in two and a half years, but it's hard \u2013 I can't answer your question fully. I know I'm forgetting one or two.\n\nFor the first ten days after I moved to KL, I slept on the floor of Keong's room in Puchong. In spite of his boasts on the phone, I knew that his life in the city wasn't going to be as glorious as he'd made it out to be \u2013 that the life of kids like us, who'd dropped out of school at sixteen, seventeen, would surely have its limitations. All I hoped for was that these limits would be higher than the ones in the village, or at the very least, different.\n\nLife in the city didn't seem to have provided Keong with the fulfilment he'd craved during his brief years in the village. He rented a room in a small apartment owned by a thin old Cantonese woman who rented her two bedrooms to young people like us, new to the city and looking for work. She herself slept on the rattan sofa in the living room, in front of the TV that was never turned off in the ten days I stayed there. Two in the morning, it was on; 8.30 in the morning, it was on; four in the afternoon \u2013 every time I walked through the door, it was on. Often, she'd be asleep, sitting half-upright in a chair, but the TV would be on. She had no family, no phone, no one to keep her company \u2013 all she looked forward to was collecting the two hundred ringgit from her tenants at the start of each month, which she kept in a biscuit tin under the sofa.\n\n'Dangerous thing for a granny to do,' Keong joked with her. 'Someone could just walk in, beat you to death and take all your money.'\n\nHe had been there for ten months, the longest he'd stayed anywhere since he moved back to KL a few years before. It was because of the view, he said \u2013 from his window on the tenth floor he could see the city spreading out before him, obscured by two other blocks of flats but present nonetheless, twenty-four-seven, reminding him of all the glorious possibilities available to him. The blinking of the lights in the evening, the smog in the daytime, drifting across the seas from Indonesia and settling over the skyline. That year the gigantic Twin Towers had just been completed, and the glow it threw up at night meant that you could see the dust particles suspended in the air, shifting constantly. Even when nothing moved, the city was changing all the time. That's how he felt. Only problem was, he was stuck in that bedroom, often sleeping until lunchtime despite the light forcing its way through the thin curtains. Why get up early when you don't have a steady job?\n\nA couple of months after he moved back, he'd tried to educate himself \u2013 saved a bit of money and enrolled in evening courses in computers and typing, and another one in _feng shui_ and astrology. Everyone knew that the future was in technology. If you could use a computer you could become a millionaire in three months by investing in stocks and shares, which was just another form of gambling, after all \u2013 and God knows he was a demon when it came to gambling. All you needed to do was to reduce the variables of fortune \u2013 and that's where _feng shui_ came in. You simply harnessed the powers of the universe, and once you were in harmony with the elements, there was no limit to what you could achieve. The internet had just arrived in the country, and shops started to appear all over town where you could go and find the news and other information on computers. That was only twenty years ago \u2013 just yesterday, it feels like. But it was a pain to go to the computer store every day, and when he did make it there, the internet connection often didn't work, and he would spend hours trying to perform the simplest tasks. He should have given up right from the start and realised that the sort of career he'd imagined for himself was reserved for people who worked in offices, who'd finished their diplomas at the age of twenty-one, twenty-two, who knew how to speak foreign languages \u2013 people like you.\n\nDuring the brief period I lived with him, he rarely stirred before I'd come back from a morning's search for work. We'd sit and share some _kuih_ that I'd bought from the street hawker outside our block, and Keong would smoke three cigarettes in a row on the narrow balcony. He asked a lot of questions about the village, wanted to hear the latest about various kids our age, whether they were still in Kuala Selangor; how my mother was; whether the fishing had been good; whether Uncle Kam's papayas were still as tasty as ever \u2013 the most mundane things you could think of. 'You're joking, meh?' I said. I never knew that he'd even noticed anyone else apart from me in the village. He'd always seemed so detached, deliberately distant, but now he was interested in the news of specific people. I have no idea why these individuals mattered more than the others, why they'd left an impression on him, but he seemed happy nonetheless to hear that Little Hong had started a small business making dumplings and _bao_ down the road, or that Fei-fei was now married and living in Klang, with a young child and another on its way. Maybe Keong had had a crush on her, who knows. I can't remember him ever having met her. He didn't take his eyes off me when I told him about the village, drinking in everything I said and forgetting to smoke his cigarette. I watched it burn steadily down as I talked, big clumps of ash falling to the ground. Beats me why he found any of it interesting.\n\nSometimes I suspected that he went back to bed after I left to spend the afternoon looking for a job. When I got back in the evening \u2013 eight, nine o'clock \u2013 he would be preparing to go out, looking after the evening shift at his friend's CD stall in Chow Kit, which I understood was code for something else. Later, after I'd moved out and was struggling a bit in between jobs, he would make a few attempts at getting me involved in his line of work \u2013 a low-level dealing in pills and powder and cash \u2013 but I could never tell the difference between _fengtau_ and Ice and G and K, and was always worried I'd make a mistake. He thought he was doing me a favour. 'Guys like us, it's the only way we can make a bit of money quickly.' But I could see that his heart wasn't in it, and he never tried very hard to convince me. He mentioned how much money he made from it, and I realised why it was dangerous \u2013 not because the drugs could kill you, or get you killed by rival gangsters or the police, or land you in jail for twenty years, but because the money was just enough to keep you going for a while without a proper job, but never \u2013 never, never, never \u2013 enough to make you feel comfortable and safe. One weekend he would earn a wad of cash big enough to last two months, other times he'd go weeks without making anything, or would have to pay his share of protection money, or subscriptions, or whatever he called it, to someone bigger and meaner, or pay a bribe to the police or the city enforcement officers who came snooping round his CD stall \u2013 always, always bribes. That one payment would dry you out for a month while you waited for your next windfall. And so on.\n\nOnce, towards the end of my time in KL, he talked about helping out a friend in a new line of business: girls. 'Helping out?' I said. 'I don't even want to know what that means.' He smiled and said, 'You're still as big a dickhead as ever.' When he laughed I could sense that what he was telling me was not a boast but a confession, a strange silent plea for help, though God only knows what I could have done. What was I supposed to do? I didn't want him messing with prostitutes. That kind of stuff was serious. I'd had over two years in the city by then; I knew when things were getting out of hand for him. I guess he wanted me to persuade him not to do it. He imagined us getting into an argument and insulting me for being a coward, and later, when he'd jacked it all in, he'd say he had only done it for me. I was the reason he'd turned down a perfectly lucrative job. But I just said nothing \u2013 what could I have said that would have made sense? _Go get yourself proper employment?_ He was just doing what he had to do.\n\nThose first ten days, sleeping on the floor of his tiny room, I didn't realise that he had already become stuck in a place he didn't want to be. I know now that he must have been taking drugs from time to time. That's why he had such strange sleeping patterns, why one time he didn't come home all night, and the next day was full of energy despite the circles under his eyes that were so dark I thought someone had punched him. Those were things that only dawned on me later, when I'd had time to figure out for myself the way the city shaped you without you even knowing what was happening to you. But right then, all I thought was, Why is Keong so miserable?\n\nI felt the complete opposite \u2013 the entire city was at my feet, I couldn't wait to get going. I found a job as a waiter at a Chinese seafood restaurant in Old Klang Road. That was my first, and also the best, though maybe I felt that way because it was the first, and I hadn't had time to realise that it was actually pretty lousy. After just a week of ferrying the orders from the kitchen to the tables and waiting until someone more senior came and served the dishes, I was given a promotion of sorts and allowed to lift the dishes from the trays and place them with a flourish on the tables before the hungry diners, while _someone else_ stood holding the tray. Such a fine distinction, invisible to the customers \u2013 I mean, do you ever notice who puts the food on the table, or who's standing like a dumb statue with the tray in their hands? \u2013 but to me it felt like a huge step up in the world.\n\nRight away, I was better than that _someone else_ \u2013 the sullen, silent person holding the tray \u2013 who was always foreign. Mostly Myanmar, Nepalese, sometimes Cambodian. They'd stand there looking at me, waiting for me to give them instructions. I'd only been there a week, ten days, but already I wielded power over them, mysteriously and without me even asking, by virtue of being the same colour and race as the forty-something-year-old couple who owned the place. I could feel it in the way these migrants looked at me, and in the way I returned their fragile smiling gazes. We both knew that one word from me accusing them of laziness or insolence and they'd be in trouble. Between their word and mine, there would be no argument. Luckily, there was no reason at that restaurant to invent a story about a foreign employee drinking on the job, or groping a Chinese waitress's ass, or being rude to a client, or some other exaggeration following an argument or a dispute over small amounts of money \u2013 mild fabrications just to get the guy sacked. Later, there would be \u2013 but not at that place.\n\nCan you blame me for feeling happy? Suddenly, I had an income \u2013 I was making a living in the city! \u2013 and at work I felt that strange sense of authority over others. For years you think no one cares about you, then all at once, in your first job, you find that there are people out there who are terrified of you. It changes the way you feel about yourself, doesn't it? The shifts were long. Twelve, thirteen hours, with a brief lull in the afternoon when the last of the stragglers from lunch had gone and the tables had been cleared, the kitchen cleaned and re-stocked for the onslaught of dinner in just over an hour's time. Most of us took a quick nap, seated near the entrance, under the ceiling fan, resting our heads on the table in front of us with our folded arms as a pillow. Sometimes, when I didn't have time for a break I'd watch the others sleeping and think that they looked like birds at rest, curled into themselves and oblivious to the world for those few minutes.\n\nI got paid eight hundred ringgit a month, which seemed a lot to me, and I could afford to rent a small room in a flat not far from Keong's.\n\nI left the seafood restaurant after about six months because I was bored and wanted more \u2013 more money, yes, but also more of everything else. More variety, more fun, more work, even. I didn't know that all the jobs I'd get would end up giving me the same sensation I had towards the end of my time at that first seafood restaurant (there would be others) \u2013 a mixture of boredom and fatigue caused not so much by the constant movement of my body over twelve hours, but by the sense of a whole universe of ease and satisfaction existing just beyond the horizons of the world I was living in. All I had to do was push beyond a silky-thin membrane and I'd be there, part of a world where comfort produced greater comfort, day after day for years without end. The thought that all that was almost within my grasp made whatever job I was working at meaningless \u2013 all that mattered was what came next.\n\nMy next two jobs were also in restaurants. Neither lasted long. They were smarter establishments than the first, and I thought I was moving up in the world. Air-con and black-and-white uniforms, and carpets in the second place. Keong laughed when I told him I was quitting again. 'Restaurant jobs are for girls,' he said. 'Young guys like us, we don't mess about taking orders from people. Brother, you got to _give_ the orders, not take them.'\n\nI worked in a tyre-repair shop and got what you might call a bit of training, but I never got used to the constant hiss of air valves and pumps and the stench of hot rubber. The guys who worked at the garage said I was good with my hands, they could see I was strong, but how long can you stay in a job like that? The oldest guy who worked there was in his seventies, Hainanese uncle with bald head and long white eyebrows. Sometimes he'd just disappear without a word, and we'd find him slumped deep in the plastic-wire armchair, fast asleep with his mouth open and spit dribbling down his chin. The trembling of his brow was the only sign he was still alive. The other guys laughed. Old Boon, wake up! They'd shout his name and sing songs, knowing that he wouldn't even stir. He'd need to sleep for at least half an hour, sometimes more, before being able to start work again, but when he did he was swift and sharp with the tools. And then, suddenly, _bang_ \u2013 KO'd again. When I looked at him I thought, I will light twenty million joss-sticks at the temple and pray to every god in the heavens, go to Chiengmai to worship magical monks, anything to avoid a fate like that.\n\nOn my nights off I realised I was starting to avoid Keong. At the beginning I'd seek him out whenever I had some spare time, and we'd go down to the stalls and eat Hokkien mee with the beer we'd bought from the 7-Eleven, or else we'd take a ride out somewhere on our scooters looking for a cheap _fengtau_ club that Keong had heard of, where he might be able to do a bit of business. He was slowly giving up on regular work, and had a lot of free time on his hands. I knew that he was dealing more and more in pills. (He changed lodgings often, and one time I arrived at his place while he was searching for a lost fifty-ringgit note. All the drawers were open and I saw his stock of pills, one or two each in neat little plastic bags, every colour you could think of.)\n\nWe turned up at this nightclub once, called W-disco. Of course I can't tell you the real name \u2013 for all I know it might still be there and the police might go and raid it, and then the owners will send some gangsters to chop me up. I thought Keong had taken me there to introduce me to nightlife in the capital, but we just hung around outside, smoking and chatting. 'You waiting for someone to turn up?' I asked after a while. Keong laughed and replied, 'Maybe.' I didn't think anything more of it \u2013 Keong had never behaved in what you might call a conventional way, even when we were in the village. I didn't mind either, I felt comfortable there, sitting on a low cement barrier in the car park, smoking and watching the people go past \u2013 mostly young men and women who looked like us, spoke like us, but a few rich kids too, climbing out of their Toyotas, and a sprinkling of Malay guys in skinny jeans and death metal T-shirts. Even outside, the music from the club was loud enough that we had to raise our voices when we spoke, and I remember thinking, _I'm a hell of a long way from Bagan Sungai Yu_. I wondered what was going on in the village at that precise moment, 11.30 on a Tuesday night, the sea flattening out into the darkness, the last light in the village long since switched off, with only the street lamps to indicate the presence of human existence. Nothing, probably. I thought of my friends, the ones who hadn't left, asleep since 8 p.m., getting ready to wake up in the pre-dawn hours to supervise the boats, the incoming catch, the trip to the wholesalers. I smiled. Fuck, what those guys would say if they saw me now.\n\n'Wait here.' Keong got up and strolled casually around the people gathered there, smoking and chatting just as we were doing. I watched him for a while, disappearing into the crowd, emerging now and then, exchanging a greeting here and there. He'd come back and start talking about random things, like the wars in the Gulf and the Balkans, or whether McDonald's ice cream was actually made of pork fat. And he'd ask questions like, 'In a war between America and Russia, who would you support?'\n\nJust as I was laughing, this rich kid came up to us, nervous as hell, and said to Keong, 'Don't rip me off, OK?' You know the type \u2013 neat hair, bright blue Ralph Lauren polo shirt, genuine for sure, not a night-market counterfeit. Silver watch, pale skin. Probably same age as me but looked about sixteen.\n\n'Heyyy, little brother, go back and relax with your friends for a while,' Keong said. 'I'll let you know when it's good. Don't believe me? Just ask your buddies.' He lit another cigarette once the kid had gone away. 'First timers \u2013 pain in the ass.' He passed me a pack of Salems, even though I was only halfway through the cigarette I was smoking. Then he gave me a fistful of cash and some instructions \u2013 told me to get into the club, leave the pack in the toilets, wait a while, and watch out for the Ralph Lauren kid. In moments like that you think, Why didn't I just say no? It would have been so easy to treat it as a joke, as just one more no-meaning thing that Keong had come up with. I could have just stood up and walked back to my scooter and said, ' _Your mother_. You've gone nuts. Seeya next week. Some of us have to work.' And gone back home. But things don't work that way \u2013 sometimes your brain doesn't recognise danger or risk until much later \u2013 days, weeks, years \u2013 and it's only then that the event feels scary, because the passing of time has made it seem that you had a choice. But at that moment, sitting there with Keong, options did not exist for me. It felt like the most natural thing in the world \u2013 the only one, in fact \u2013 to provide him with the answer he wanted, and grant my approval. ' _En_.' You might say that I could have bailed out at any time, but once I was inside the disco everything I did became melded together to form part of one continuous decision; every tiny action felt necessary and unavoidable \u2013 making my way to the toilets was the only way to escape the mass of people dancing with their heads shaking wildly; pretending to wash my hands was the sole means of making myself appear innocent; waiting for Ralph Lauren boy to appear was my way of assuring my friendship with Keong and being part of city life. I had placed the pack of Salems on a ledge in front of me, slightly to my right, in between two basins, so that if the police burst in I'd be able to claim ignorance, but if anyone else tried to take them I'd say they were mine. Don't ask me how I figured that out, I just did \u2013 throw someone in the sea and they'll find a way to swim. The more I tried not to look at the pack, the more it appeared in my field of vision, green and white, crushed along one edge. I pretended to wash my hands. Washing, washing, waiting. People came in, they went out. No one touched the cigarettes. Finally the kid walked in. I motioned with my chin towards the pack, and made to leave. He said, 'Wait.' We were alone. He opened the pack, took out the three cigarettes that were inside and dropped them to the damp floor, where they immediately started to soak up the dark yellow muck of piss and dirty water. He shook the pack and cupped a pink tablet in his palm. Quickly, he put it in his mouth and left without looking at me.\n\nOutside, Keong was still sitting on the low concrete wall, and when I joined him he said, 'If the world was taken over by aliens, what would be your final meal?'\n\n' _Fuck_ you. _Chaohai._ '\n\n'Relaaaax. Nothing bad happened to you, right? Calm down and grow up.'\n\nHe was right. It wasn't a big deal, it was just part of life. I'd helped out a friend from my village, nothing more. That's how I tried to square things in my head, and sure enough, after a few days I didn't think I'd done anything out of the ordinary that night. I'd just helped a buddy with something he had to do.\n\nStill, I began to drift away from Keong, and though we'd occasionally meet for late-night supper down at the stalls, our lives were pulling apart and I felt less and less desire to search him out. He was drifting through life, experimenting with things that would lead nowhere \u2013 what else could he have done, to be fair? \u2013 but I wasn't ready for that in-between life, the fun always shadowed by fear. We're young, he once said, Life is long. But he knew that wasn't true, that people like us didn't have time on our side. We weren't like the cool Ralph Lauren boy who time favoured, we were already hustling for a living, already looked ten years older than him. For us, it was the opposite, in fact, and every day I told myself, _Hurry, you don't have much time_. I was in the city, I had to learn things, see things; I had to nail down some kind of life for myself.\n\nOne night, over noodles and beer at a _dai cau_ place in Puchong, Keong told me he'd pack it all in one day, take off to Guangzhou, where big business was starting to happen \u2013 it would be easy for people like us because we could speak Cantonese. We start a business, marry a girl from Chaozhou and make a fortune. Doing what? I asked, but he just shrugged. 'Whatever,' he said. 'Whatever it takes.'\n\nI don't know where he went, whether he actually made it to China as he said he would, but a couple of weeks later he was gone. I went to the DVD stalls in Low Yat, Chow Kit, all the places he'd worked at, but the answer everywhere was the same. Keong is gone, and no one knows where. I should have been worried about him \u2013 in his line of work, the people he hung around, he might have been hurt, or in jail, or chased out of town \u2013 but instead I was relieved. Happy. The kind of quiet joy that made me feel airy and weightless, like a shred of cloth swirling in the river when the tide pulls in. Because maybe he really had achieved his dreams and gone to China to find wealth and a pretty bride. But mostly because he had slipped out of my life and I wouldn't have to see him again. I hadn't realised it, but his presence was like the little thorny spine in the base of my foot \u2013 hardly a problem at all, barely noticeable most days, but present nonetheless, and always threatening to turn into something more painful, even if I never knew exactly what shape that pain would assume. It was that threat \u2013 that idea of something terrible that might or might not happen \u2013 that disappeared when Keong left town.\n\nOn the surface nothing much changed in my life. I kept working, and looking for work when I wasn't working. I never spent more than a few days without employment. No big change, some would say \u2013 still a loser's life. But without Keong, I felt free.\n\nMy last job in the city was at a neighbourhood restaurant called Fatty Crab, which was much more profitable than you'd think if you saw it \u2013 it was just a coffee shop on the corner of a typical block of shophouses in a housing estate, which wasn't so rich back then, but I guess not poor either. All around that estate, new ones were being built, bigger and smarter, providing an endless supply of customers.\n\nA deep open drain ran by the side of the restaurant, and over the years the grease from woks and grills had turned the cement black, so it looked as if you were staring into a bottomless chasm. But that didn't put people off, and neither did the cramped tables and half-broken plastic chairs and ceiling fans that didn't work. Maybe it was precisely because it was a simple restaurant, modestly priced, that it was so popular. People drove across town and waited patiently for up to an hour to sample the crab and satay and chicken wings, and it was full all the time.\n\nThe boss-lady, Ah Leng Chee, drove a Mercedes SLK. Can you imagine that, old auntie driving a German sports car? Dressed like an auntie too, old nylon trousers and plain blouses, dyed black hair thinning so much that you could see her scalp, powdered face to keep the heat at bay \u2013 you'd never know she was rich until you saw her climb into that car. Arrived from Kuantan nearly thirty years previously, and now look at her \u2013 driving a Mercedes and raking it in. She was nineteen when she moved to KL \u2013 exactly my age when I did. Maybe that was why she loved me as she did, not because she didn't have a son, which you might have been tempted to believe was the reason, but because she saw a version of herself in me. That's why she paid me a thousand a month to supervise the seating of the customers and keep an eye out to make sure the orders were delivered on time. It wasn't a demanding job, so in the afternoons I helped the Nepalese workers with the heavy manual work, unloading the sacks of rice and vegetables, and late at night, stacking the dozens of tables and hundreds of chairs before sluicing down the floor. ' _Gone crazy_ , _meh_?' she'd bark when she saw me with my trouser legs rolled up to my knees, sweeping the grime from the floor while Bhim or one of the other Nepalese aimed the hosepipe. And though she never smiled when she said it, I knew her words were meant as praise. Sometimes I'd look at her while I was carrying out this final task, late at night, watch her patiently adding up the receipts, and I'd try to imagine her arriving in the city, a young woman my age, all those years ago. But I'd never really be able to visualise it \u2013 she was always just a kind old auntie to me.\n\nShe had a daughter who lived in San Francisco, a few years older than I was back then. She came to visit once, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt with the name of her college printed on it \u2013 I can't remember which one now. [ _Pause_.] It was getting to the end of the lunch hour, but the restaurant was still full and noisy, with voices and laughter on top of the clatter of plates and the shouting from the kitchen beyond, with the din from the passing traffic in the street mixed into all of it. She stood behind the counter watching us rush from table to table, her mother helping us take orders and even serve the food. We were short-staffed that day, I seem to remember, though I can't recall why. I thought she was taking it all in, as if she was enjoying a movie, and I began to worry what she thought of us, that maybe she found us shabby and dumb. _Primitive_. That was the word that came to my mind; she found us primitive, unsophisticated. She'd have looked at the four Nepalese, two Burmese and me, and thought, _Poor things, they're so underdeveloped_. But as I walked past the counter on the way to the kitchen I noticed that she wasn't looking at us at all \u2013 her eyes were just staring into space, even though her lips were pulled into a smile. She was sweating, wisps of hair stuck to her forehead and her temples, the ceiling fans doing nothing to relieve her discomfort. At one point I thought I'd caught her eye, so I smiled back, but she just kept gazing into the distance, her pleasant expression intended for no one. That's when I realised she didn't want to be there at all, that it must have been torture for her to be in that cheap restaurant. No air-con. Oily floors. Half the customers wearing soccer shorts or clothes that could have passed for pyjamas. When I saw things through her eyes I felt sorry for her, having to put up with the noise and heat and grease.\n\nShe was missing her fianc\u00e9, Ah Leng Chee explained later, and couldn't wait to get back to the US. 'Her boyfriend _angmoh_ is it?' I asked \u2013 I don't know why it felt important. She lived in San Francisco, it wouldn't be surprising if she lived with a white guy. Ah Leng Chee nodded and fell silent for a long while. 'Yes. Getting married next year.'\n\n'Not coming back to take over the business?'\n\nAh Leng Chee shrugged. 'You young people, you just do what you want.' It turned out her daughter already had a Green Card, and was planning to live in the States forever. 'When I moved to KL she was just a small child. Look at her now.' She visited two, three times in the space of a week, then I never saw her again.\n\nOne night, just as the dinner sitting was winding down and the last of the customers were at that point where they were thinking about leaving but couldn't, because they'd eaten too much and were feeling too lethargic, and the place was quieter, less rushed, and the staff starting to relax \u2013 a couple of scooters pulled up outside. I don't know why, but I noticed them immediately \u2013 scooters buzz up and down the road all day and night, but these were different. The deliberate drawing to a halt, one in the laneway next to the kitchens, the other right in front of the restaurant, engines killed almost at the same time. I've often heard it said that in such moments time expands, things happen in slow motion. People talk about being able to recall every detail, about watching dumbstruck and not being able to react because the actions they observe are out of step with time. But I can't believe that. When you're in the midst of violence, everything occurs swiftly. It swirls around you, envelops you, doesn't let you go, and you react, God knows you react. And so it was that even as I saw the three men enter the restaurant, the long curved blades of their machetes raised in the air, I rushed over to Ah Leng Chee, who had just started to count up the day's takings, the piles of cash arranged neatly on the counter.\n\nThat was her money. [ _Pause_.] _Our_ money.\n\nAnd she did not remain silent as those slow-motion stories of terror would have you believe, but was already screaming as I reached her side and tried to shield her from the men. She was making a noise I didn't think she was capable of, a high-pitched cry that repeated and repeated as I grappled with one of the men, and suddenly a couple of the Nepalese workers were with me, throwing their slender frames at the robbers. In a few seconds it was over, and as the men escaped on their bikes Ah Leng Chee ran out, as if she was going to try to catch them, shouting, ' _Damned black devils! Damned black devils!_ ' There was cash all over the floor. I started to gather it up \u2013 all our pay, what we needed to survive, scattered across the restaurant. As I started to collect it I noticed long streaks of blood across the chipped grey tiles and thought, _She's hurt_. But Ah Leng Chee was still standing at the threshold of the restaurant shouting out into the darkness. I looked up and saw Sujan, the Nepalese cook, sitting on the floor, propped up against the counter with his hand clutching his arm. The others were standing over him, talking to him, cajoling him the way a mother would when she tried to lull a baby to sleep, only they were trying to keep him from falling unconscious, their voices low and urgent, as if their own lives depended on him staying awake. His fingers gripped his arm so tightly that I had difficulty prising them open, and when I did, I caught sight of bright white bone amid the ribbons of purple-red flesh. One of the boys handed me a clean cloth for a tourniquet, and I lashed the wound as tightly as I could.\n\nAh Leng Chee was still shouting into the darkness, her voice starting to get hoarse. I noticed that my arms and clothes were covered in blood \u2013 a gash ran across my forearm. The diners were standing up, arranged in a neat semi-circle behind some tables that we'd started to stack up, like a row of spectators at a show, watching silently. 'Can someone please take this man to hospital,' I said. The money was still strewn across the floor. A man replied, 'We should call the police.' No, I said, _take him to the damn hospital_. Finally a young woman raised her hand and pointed to a BMW parked outside the restaurant. Five of us carried Sujan out to the car, with Bhim cradling his head and shoulders. The woman opened the door to her car and we placed him flat on the back seat. Even in the half-dark I could see the blood spreading over the pale leather upholstery and trickling into the seams, and I felt bad because the woman would have to spend a lot of money cleaning it all up. As I climbed into the passenger seat my arm began to sting, a sharp pain pushing through the numbness that had been there before, yet all I could think of was that the blood was going to drip onto the car seat, and I tried to think of ways to get rid of the stains, maybe rub salt and vinegar into them. I worried about that a lot on the way to the hospital.\n\nNext day, Ah Leng Chee sacked the Bangladeshi guy who worked as a kitchen porter. Just like that. She was convinced that he'd tipped off his friends and told them about the cash she counted out every night. 'They weren't foreign, they were locals,' I said.\n\n'You saw their identity cards, meh?' she asked. 'Anyway, _these guys_ \u2013 they're all the same.'\n\n[ _Pause. Rolls up sleeve to display a scar._ ]\n\nI don't know how I didn't feel it when they slashed me, but the cut was clean and deep, and took a while to heal. [ _Traces finger along the diagonal mark, about four inches long; other smaller scars also visible_.] I guess you could say that it left me with some memories of that evening. [ _Laughs_.]\n\nAbout six months after that, I arrived at work and saw that Ah Leng Chee was already there, which was unusual \u2013 I was normally the one who opened up the restaurant each morning, just before ten, and closed up around midnight. She trusted me with tasks like that, she knew I'd keep things safe. That day there was a lot of dust in the air \u2013 not the usual haze that floated over the city, but thicker clouds of it coming from the construction sites nearby, where those patches of sparse city jungle were being cleared to build a new housing estate. Ah Leng Chee was wearing a surgical mask that covered her mouth and nose, which in those days was a rare sight. Now even fashionable people wear them, but back then it was something that only people in Japan and Taiwan knew about, and I used to laugh at it. 'You think you're a Japanese scientist?' I used to joke, but that day I have to admit that I wished I had one too. She lowered her mask and said, 'Ah Hock, you can't work here any more.' Business hadn't been good, she hadn't been making much money for some time. She had taken out a loan, and now she was struggling to make the repayments. She had decided to get rid of me and three other workers, the ones who earned the most; the ones who remained would just have to manage a bigger workload. She wasn't going to lie: if business picked up again she'd employ another foreigner rather than rehire me \u2013 they were so much cheaper. 'So, you can't work here any more.' She pulled the mask back up over her nose and mouth and returned to her calculator and the pile of receipts.\n\nI stood watching the clouds of red dust and the bulldozers in the distance, the grit in my mouth and throat starting to itch. She hadn't said, 'I'm sorry, I have to let you go.' Or, 'You're lazy, I'm going to sack you.' Or, 'Business is bad, I can't afford to employ you any more.' She'd just said, _You can't work here any more_. She'd said it as if it was inevitable, as if nothing on earth could prevent the termination of my employment at Restoran Fatty Crab \u2013 as if the end of my time there was as natural as the monsoon season that arrives and disappears without fail each year. But even that wasn't guaranteed. Some years we didn't get any rain, others we got too much. Why couldn't I continue working there, even for just a few months longer? Because the city was going to be destroyed by an earthquake? Because we were going to be invaded by extra-terrestrials? If so, I could accept it. No one would have a job, so why should I? I'm not an unreasonable man. Give me one good reason and I always walk away quietly.\n\n'Ah Hock, why are you just standing there?' she said at last. 'Don't be like that, it's not my fault.'\n\nI looked at her. Didn't do anything else, just looked at her \u2013 and that was enough to get her worked up, because she thought I was being insolent. Challenging her for a better reason, or financial compensation, or something else she couldn't provide. She started talking \u2013 shouting, really. About things that weren't important to me, explaining about her balance sheet and her daughter on the other side of the world, who still needed money, about the pressures of the job, of being a mother. About how I was so ignorant I didn't know how the world worked. Didn't I know about this thing called the Asian Financial Crisis? Why didn't I read the papers a bit more, and take an interest in the world? That was the kind of thing she was shouting at me. Every country in Asia had been suffering, and there I was behaving like a spoilt child. _Twenty-two years old, still acting like a kid!_ All the bribes she had to pay, protection money, price hikes \u2013 did I even know about all that? I had no idea how tough running a business in this shithole country could be, she said; I had no idea what it was like to be a woman her age, all alone, trying to run a stupid restaurant. 'When you get to my age you'll know what it feels like.'\n\n'What about the others?'\n\n'Go back to Myanmar lor. Nepal, Bangla \u2013 like you care?' Then she cursed, just one rude word, not a big deal, but coming from a nice lady like her it sounded so funny that I started to laugh, and then I couldn't stop. I was standing in the middle of the restaurant, the tables and chairs in piles around me, laughing like a demon in an old kung-fu movie, and I could see the others who'd arrived for work staring at me as if I was dangerous. 'Crazy! What the hell are you laughing about?' Ah Leng Chee was shouting. 'What's so funny?' The more she yelled at me, the harder it was for me to stop. I closed my eyes, and all I could see was the image of her, sweet old auntie, saying that bad word, and I laughed so hard I was crying and feeling my ribcage compress so much that I had trouble breathing; and the dust in my throat was getting worse, so I was laughing and coughing at the same time. Some of the other workers were giggling too, and Ah Leng Chee said, 'That's it, he's gone mad.' When I walked out of the place I was still laughing.\n\nI thought that was the end of the matter. But at the trial, nearly ten years later, the prosecution brought up this episode. I was amazed that anyone remembered it, but they did \u2013 they spent a long time asking questions about that day. About my laughing \u2013 somehow it had become proof of my madness. My instability. _My inability to recognise the gravity of serious situations_. They'd found the girl from Yangon who washed the dishes, her plump boyfriend who worked on the satay grill. How did the police find them? I didn't think they'd last more than a few months in the country, I didn't think they even had papers \u2013 but here they were, just short of a decade later, answering questions in passable Malay. _Would you say that the defendant was disconnected from reality?_ When I'd known them all those years before, I'd sometimes joke with them, call them rude names in Malay, but they just smiled \u2013 they didn't understand a word.\n\nWhen it was Ah Leng Chee's turn to take the witness stand I knew she wanted to help me, to tell everyone that I wasn't crazy or dangerous. Several times she started to say, 'He's a good boy, hard-working...' but each time they cut her short. 'Just answer the question, Madam Wong. What was his reaction when you told him you were sacking him?'\n\nHow long did he laugh? Five\u2013six\u2013seven minutes without stopping?\n\nSo, would you say he was... hysterical? Out of control?\n\nYou said at the time he'd... gone _mad_?\n\nShe looked at me from across the courtroom, and I got the feeling she was asking for forgiveness, which was strange, because she had done nothing wrong. She was answering the questions truthfully, just as she was expected to do \u2013 there was nothing for her to be sorry about, nothing for me to forgive. I remembered her yelling at me that day, remembered the other people arriving at work, the restaurant starting to come to life \u2013 the two Indian guys delivering gas canisters, the booming metallic sound they made as they lowered them to the concrete floor in the kitchen, the Tamil song they were singing, _Nila, nila odivaa_... and the waiters, Bhim and the others, pulling back the shutters, the light falling on the sacks of vegetables. Sujan struggling to set up a table on his own, his right arm healed now but stiff, like a puppet's. Ah Leng Chee's single, sharp swear word. As I remembered the sensation of laughing at how beautiful and ridiculous it had all been, I put my hand over my mouth to hide my smile, but I couldn't stifle the laughter that was starting to force its way out. Ah Leng Chee looked at me from the witness stand and smiled back. I remembered, also, the folded notes of cash that she used to give me now and then \u2013 just ten, twenty ringgit \u2013 and the little gifts, like a bar of chocolate or a keychain, whenever she came back from a trip out of town. I started laughing. [ _Pause_.] I covered my face with my hands.\n\nThe prosecutor had been speaking in long elegant sentences that rumbled gently like distant thunder, but he interrupted himself for a second to turn and look at me. Through the tiny gaps in my fingers I saw him glance at me before starting to talk again. The tone of his voice changed slightly, as if to say: You see? I was right \u2013 this guy is mad.\n\nAfter I left Restoran Fatty Crab I drifted about for a few days, and got turned down for a couple of jobs. There wasn't a lot of work available, but in truth I wasn't looking too hard. I know this sounds like one of the stories you're interested in, about a boy from the village who comes to the big capital city and gets crushed by how brutal it is, but that's not exactly right. I wasn't defeated by KL, I got bored of it \u2013 I wanted something better. A couple of weeks later I was back in Klang, and quite quickly found the job at the fish farm. If I hadn't left KL, I wouldn't have started making a decent living so soon. Someone like me, with no qualifications at all \u2013 I didn't think anyone would want to marry me, but they did.\n\n##\n\nThe thought comes to me suddenly, in the middle of a sentence.\n\nIt's a normal session, nothing out of the ordinary. I'm talking, she's sitting back in her chair with her notebook in her lap. I can see her handwriting, tiny and perfectly neat. Now and then she stops to underline a word. I guess it's something I've said. All at once I think: I've talked too much. I talk all the time, while she remains silent. She knows everything about me, I know nothing about her.\n\nAre you all right? she says.\n\nI nod.\n\nYou were starting to tell me about your mother and the relationship she had with your uncle.\n\nCan I ask you a question?\n\nSure.\n\nWhat's your family like? I mean \u2013 you have sisters or brothers? How old are your parents? Do they still work?\n\nThat's a lot of questions. I have kind of a normal family. Parents still around, still at loggerheads like the proverbial black sheep and white sheep on a bridge. Three brothers, all doing different things.\n\nThree brothers? Must have been tricky being the only girl.\n\nYeah. I had to learn to survive. Actually, they're quite sweet. When they're not being assholes.\n\nYour parents work?\n\nDad still does, yes. Anyway, enough about me. I'm interested to know about your mother, the time she started living with another man.\n\nBut I'm interested in your background too. Your life.\n\nShe smiles and shrugs her shoulders.\n\nWe're here for your story. This is about you.\n\nYou said we'd have a conversation. That's a two-way thing, isn't it?\n\nIt's nice of you to ask. But yours is the story that counts. I'm here to listen to you.\n\nI wait for a few moments, hoping she'll change her mind. In the pause, I can hear an ambulance somewhere in the distance.\n\nAll right, she says. You were talking about your mother?\n\n##\n\n_October 19th_\n\n_Why?_ That's what you want to know, just like everyone else. But like the others, you're going to be disappointed. Many people asked me the same question. My lawyer did, numerous times \u2013 'just to establish a motive', she explained. The other lawyer, the one prosecuting, asked all kinds of questions, some of which seemed to be unconnected to the actual crime, like, 'Where did you have dinner that evening?' and 'How would you describe your mood that night?' but I understood that they were aimed at the same thing: trying to figure out why I did it.\n\nMy wife \u2013 my ex-wife, I mean \u2013 didn't come to the trial. Why would she, after all? But I saw her photo in the newspapers. Some journalists found out where she lived and wanted to speak to her, perhaps just the way you're talking to me now, in the hope of understanding a little more about me. If you manage to locate the newspapers I'm talking about, you'll see a series of photos of her walking hurriedly, the journalists holding their microphones a couple of steps behind her. But she doesn't want to say anything, she pushes past them at the front gate, shielding her face from the cameras with her handbag. But once she's inside and tries to lock the gate, she has to use both hands. She's forced to lower the handbag, and that's why they were able to get those photos of her face, crumpled from the heat, from discomfort and frustration and many other things I can't put my finger on. In the main picture she looks up, straight at the camera, and although \u2013 according to the report \u2013 she never uttered a single word, her expression screams out the same question: Why?\n\nWhen I looked at the image, I knew that the question was not directed at the journalists but at me. She didn't need to know why they were harassing her \u2013 that was obvious. Her _why_ was meant for me. Why did I do it? _Why why why why_.\n\nI met Jenny by mistake. She was destined for someone else, someone better, but ended up with me. I first saw her name on invoices we'd been sent. Jenny Teoh, Accounts Manager \u2013 she always made sure to include her title, even on the smallest bill, and when we started to use email, hers were still signed with her name and position. _Received with thx, Jenny Teoh ACCOUNTS MANAGER_ , so I always knew she had an important position. This was a few years after I joined the fish farm, when business was growing fast and we were starting to sell our products to restaurants and supermarkets all over the Klang Valley, even as far south as Johor. I was working outdoors all the time, supervising the construction of the new cages and the growing number of outbuildings, and back then we were even considering building staff quarters within the compound for the Indonesian workers. The closer they were to work, the less likely they were to run away, the boss said. Mr Lai had firm ideas about how to run the business. He didn't like it when workers quit suddenly, when they disappeared and none of the others could tell us what had happened to them. One day they were working normally, next day they were gone. It was because they had to travel a long way to work, two to a scooter, sometimes even on foot \u2013 a journey like that gives you time to think about what you're doing, and when you reflect on your life, it isn't pretty. That's when people bail out.\n\nNot long before that I noticed a flimsy camp appear on the edge of the jungle, about twenty feet from the road, built around a small abandoned concrete block that must once have been a grocery store or coffee shop. A few bits of tarpaulin stretched from tree trunks to the derelict house. A fire was burning, small children sat around it idly throwing sticks into the flame. You could tell in an instant that it was a migrant camp, and Mr Lai was worried that one or two of our men might have been living there. 'The rains come, they're gone. Police come, they're gone.' He wanted them as close to work as possible, so they wouldn't have any excuses for not turning up.\n\nThat month alone we'd lost two men and were struggling with the workload. Mr Lai was pushing us all the time, and he'd just bought the piece of land that backed onto our existing plot \u2013 the men spent all day cutting down the trees, and Mr Lai himself was on site to plan the dormitory block as well as a new generator plant. I was doing everything \u2013 hours in the sun again, doing the work of the two men who'd just disappeared, then trying to help out with the paperwork. The sales manager, a city-boy type called Toh, was complaining that he was always on the road, always driving, always arriving home after dinner, that he never saw his young children because they had long since gone to bed by the time he got home. One day he'd be in Seremban, next day in Rawang, last week he even had to go to Tapah. What the hell. On top of all that he had to call in at the farm at least three times a week to collect samples, make sure the paperwork and money were in order, check his messages. 'Everyone's pulling me in different directions. Soon I'm going to snap,' he said. 'Break into a thousand small pieces.'\n\n'Still complaining meh?' Mr Lai shouted. 'No work \u2013 cry. Too much work \u2013 also cry. Go die, eh.'\n\nI couldn't stop myself from smiling. Toh earned a lot more than me \u2013 I don't know how much but it was substantial, at least twice as much, I'd guess. I didn't ever make a thing of it, not to him or to Mr Lai \u2013 it was only normal: he had an education, he was good with computers and numbers and papers, quicker and more at ease than me in the office. Those things count in life, I understood that. Still, it gave me a small feeling of satisfaction to hear Mr Lai slap him down like that. Two days later he called in sick \u2013 or rather, his wife did. He was too ill to get to the phone, she said, had barely been out of bed for thirty-six hours. 'What a feeble excuse,' I said to Jezmine, the secretary, who'd answered the phone. 'Such a coward, had to ask his wife to call.' He could have done it himself from bed \u2013 everyone knew he had a mobile phone by then.\n\n_Pok kai_ , _ham ka chan_ , _sei lun tao_. Mr Lai couldn't stop cursing, the worst words you can imagine. Just as well you don't understand Cantonese \u2013 I'm too shy to translate that. There was a big contract that we needed to close, our main client was thinking about doubling the amount of stock they bought from us for distribution in Singapore, and that lazy wimp Toh had fallen ill just when he was due to conclude the deal. When Mr Lai had regained his breath he stood in the office with his hands on his hips and looked at us \u2013 me and Jezmine \u2013 as if he was noticing us for the very first time. The top button of his shirt was undone, and he was fanning himself with a folded copy of that day's _Nanyang Siang Pau_. 'You two will have to attend the meeting this afternoon. Don't screw up.'\n\nJezmine shrugged. She was twenty-three years old, only a couple of years younger than me then, but she wasn't ruffled. She looked at her watch and said, 'We leave in an hour.' Then she returned to her desk and started reading the _N\u00fcyou_ magazine that she'd been poring over earlier.\n\n'Don't we have to do some... I don't know, preparations?' I asked.\n\n'Sure. Do whatever you want.'\n\nAs we walked into the client's office \u2013 two floors of a modern air-conditioned row of shophouses in Taman Bukit Kuda \u2013 I silently repeated the key figures that I'd memorised earlier \u2013 our annual sales, turnover, and so on. I'd highlighted them in green fluorescent ink so I wouldn't forget them, and placed them in a folder of documents I'd prepared for the meeting. I'd put on the clean shirt I kept at the farm in case of unexpected visits from clients \u2013 in the past, there'd been occasions when I'd been helping the labourers dig the soil or prepare the foundations for new buildings, and had been surprised by the sudden arrival of buyers who wanted to inspect the farm. When fancy people turn up, it's better not to greet them with half-dried cement on your hands, walking around barefoot with your trousers rolled up to your knees like a peasant, so I learned to keep a spare set of clothes in case of emergencies. Now, as we walked up the stairs, I felt that I at least looked convincingly professional.\n\nIt didn't take me long to realise that the Jenny who greeted us was the same one who signed all the invoices. The fact that she didn't speak much, the directness of her tone when she did, the matter-of-fact manner of asking questions that sounded ironic, like 'So, is your business actually profitable these days?' \u2013 all that was exactly the way she wrote her messages to us. She didn't intend to be rude or sarcastic, that was just the way she was. She looked at me and said, 'If you're the foreman, I guess your job's just to look after all the manual stuff \u2013 so why are you here?'\n\nI started to reel off the facts and figures I'd learned by heart, but even as I was speaking I knew I was getting it all wrong, all the numbers and terminology I'd rehearsed silently in the car, trying not to move my lips so Jezmine wouldn't catch on to what I was doing \u2013 I was messing it all up, stumbling over my words and flicking through the documents in my file to try to find the relevant information. But paperwork and me, we've never got along, and I knew that the answers I was looking for were not going to surrender themselves to me, no matter how hard I searched. I could see her watching me struggle \u2013 she was only a few years older than me, about thirty, I'd guess, but her neat blouse and dark businesswoman-type trousers, with sharp creases down the front, made her seem older and wiser. For a few minutes, no one spoke \u2013 only the shuffling of my papers broke the silence in that small glassed-off meeting room.\n\n'Remember the floods last year?' Jezmine said, almost excitedly \u2013 exactly the way she might have done if she'd been sitting in McDonald's and chatting with her friends over a milkshake. 'We were the only farm in the entire state of Selangor not to be affected!' She started to provide information on our business the way the clever students recited poetry during competitions at school, without consulting any notes, pausing at the right moment, the rise and fall of her voice as steady as a stream of music \u2013 but instead of feeling stupid as I might have done at school, I felt relief, even gratitude. I sat smiling while she spoke, nodding when she employed terms like 'year-on-year profit', even though I didn't understand what they meant. I knew she was doing enough to secure the business that the farm needed. 'And all that is because Mr Lee here insisted we made our fish cages bigger and deeper than industry standards, and installed an expensive filtration system to ensure the highest-quality products.'\n\nI blushed. It was true, though \u2013 I had done that.\n\nJenny looked at me and smiled for the first time in the meeting. Turning to Jezmine, she said, 'I guess men have their uses after all.'\n\nI can't remember how we ended up going on our first date \u2013 we never experienced a big turning point, no moment of rupture between our professional relationship and a personal one. That moment in Korean dramas where colleagues realise that, _Yes! They are actually in love_ , or even just, _Hey,_ _something is happening here_ \u2013 we didn't experience that. Instead we simply progressed from one meeting to another, until it turned out that we were a couple. Much later, in the middle stages of our marriage, when we finally felt comfortable in our married skins, she would tease me for my lack of romance. 'You never courted me,' she'd say, and I'd reply, 'I wanted to let you court _me_.' In a sense, the gradual evolution of our beginning \u2013 so slow that neither of us recognised it as the start of something \u2013 would set the tone for our marriage. Things crept up on us, stealthily, and were almost over by the time we could even put a name to what we were experiencing \u2013 we could neither savour what was beautiful nor remedy what was bitter, we merely clutched at the final impressions of whatever it was we'd experienced and thought, _It's finished_. Tenderness, anger, regret \u2013 we didn't recognise them until it was too late.\n\nAfter that initial meeting, Mr Lai had been so pleased with the signing of the new contract that he put me in charge of managing affairs with Jenny's company. I told him that it shouldn't be me, that Jezmine was better with numbers and at talking to customers, but he insisted that I deal with them. 'That pretty accounts manager, she prefers to deal with a man.'\n\nJenny and I got used to seeing each other from time to time, and one day she texted me to say that her office was under renovation, and could I meet at the _bak kut teh_ place across the road instead, but when I got there I found the noise from the traffic was as bad as any construction site, and we had to struggle to make ourselves heard over the scooters and buses passing by outside, the chatter of the breakfast crowd. I tried to tell her about developments on the farm \u2013 Jezmine had prepared a few sheets of figures to show how well we were doing \u2013 but Jenny kept shaking her head, asking me to repeat myself, and when our bowls of soup arrived we both felt grateful for the excuse not to talk. We ate with our heads bowed, concentrating on the food \u2013 I ate mine slowly, taking great care not to slurp it too noisily as I normally did. We went some time without speaking, and finally she said, 'It's like we're on a date. Ever notice how people on a first date seldom talk? They're too awkward to express any emotion.'\n\nI blushed. And although I'd been trying hard to remember my table manners, I found myself lifting my bowl to my mouth and gulping down the remainder of the soup and savouring the thick sediment at the bottom, the best part. ' _Wah_ , you eat so quickly,' she said. I noticed that her meal was only half-finished. 'I guess it's habit, working on a farm like you do.'\n\nI nodded. I didn't want to explain that in fact the habit came from childhood \u2013 I'd always eaten quickly, even as a kid.\n\nAfter that we started meeting more regularly, always for dinner at the end of a day's work, when I'd ride into town on the new Yamaha I'd bought. We'd go to places she knew \u2013 simple spots tucked away in Pandamaran, Bukit Tinggi, even in areas you wouldn't expect to find decent eating places, like Taman Sentosa or Teluk Kapas. At first I was worried she'd mind being on a motorbike instead of in a car \u2013 a girl like her who worked in an air-conditioned office \u2013 but she never complained, and I was grateful for that, until the day I arrived at her office to collect her and she showed me a bag of shopping from Jusco mall. She'd bought some clothes for me \u2013 a fresh white shirt and light-coloured slacks that she'd washed and pressed, as well as some black leather shoes. 'You want me to treat you to somewhere fancy tonight, is that it?' I joked as I got changed in the men's restroom.\n\nShe just smiled and said, 'I should have bought you some new underpants too.'\n\nShe insisted on leaving the bike and taking a taxi, even though it was only a short distance to the restaurant, a Nyonya place in Taman Bayu Perdana that was a bit fancier than the coffee shops and street stalls and open-air _dai cau_ joints we'd usually go to \u2013 but still not what you'd call a luxury restaurant, and I couldn't understand why she'd made such a big deal about taking me there. We were seated at a quiet table close to the counter, and after a few minutes the owner himself emerged from the kitchen \u2013 a well-preserved man in his late sixties, I'd guess, shirt tucked into his trousers, a small shiny gold buckle on his belt. His hair was thick and black, combed to one side and slick with Brylcreem. I remember thinking: _His hair is younger than his face_. He stopped and stared at us for a while before smiling.\n\n'Pa,' Jenny said, 'this is Hock Lye. The one I've told you about.'\n\nI stood up and shook his hand.\n\n'Hock Lye. You're Hokkien too? That's good.'\n\nAs I exchanged pleasantries with Jenny's father, I realised that the previous three months had in fact been our period of courtship \u2013 that beautiful time when young men are supposed to romance their prospective partners and future wives \u2013 yet I had done nothing of the sort. Instead I'd just drifted through our meetings without making any effort to impress her at all. Now, in a matter of minutes, we had become boyfriend\u2013girlfriend, and it was down to her.\n\nMr Teoh sat down with us and chatted while we waited for our food. He'd opened the restaurant about six or seven years before, one last big venture before he retired. He'd started out as a Hokkien _mee_ seller in the Old Town, just a stand in a coffee shop \u2013 sweaty, hard work, but he was young and energetic and business was good, so after a few years he was able to open his own _kopitiam_ on the other side of the river, not far from the bus terminal, where he continued his noodle business but rented out three other stands too. And here's the thing \u2013 he decided to buy the lot that the coffee shop occupied, including the two storeys above, a huge investment at the time. People told him, You're crazy, you're too young, you'll go bankrupt. But he thought, What the hell, even if I go bankrupt I'll just start again, I'm only twenty-eight years old. Who'd have thought that property even in boring old Klang would increase in value so much? Business continued to be good, and when he sold up, he started not one but two new restaurants, and so on.\n\nHe was only telling me all this to share the lessons he'd learned in life. He could see that I was the sensible type and wanted to achieve success. But no doubt I'd have my own ideas, he joked. 'In the end, every man must follow his own path, yes or not?'\n\nOf course, in the meantime he had got married to Jenny's mother, who had been a primary school teacher. His poor wife had died of cancer a few years back \u2013 she was still young, it was so unfair. Oh, he was lucky to have met her \u2013 imagine, a teacher getting married to a noodle seller! But he was clever, he had waited until he was financially secure before looking for a wife, and he was able to offer her everything she wanted. Her entire life, she didn't have to worry about food on the table or paying the electricity bill. 'Will _you_ be able to provide the same for _your_ wife?' he asked, smiling.\n\nThe food arrived and Mr Teoh stood up to leave. I bade him goodbye and watched him climb into a Suzuki 4\u00d74 parked outside. Why a restaurant owner needed an off-road car like that, I didn't know. It's not as if he needed to drive across the Sahara. Maybe that's just one of those things you do when you've got money \u2013 you buy yourself things you don't need.\n\nUnusually, that evening I found I had no appetite. 'What's wrong? Don't like the food?' Jenny asked.\n\n'No no, it's nice.' I helped myself to more even though I didn't feel like it, and forced myself to eat.\n\n'Then what?'\n\nI shrugged. I couldn't explain it. 'Nyonya food is a bit too rich for my liking.'\n\nShe laughed and ruffled my hair. 'You have such country-boy tastebuds!'\n\nWhen we got married four months later, we moved into a small house in Taman Sentosa, just next to the Klang Bypass highway \u2013 a single-storey link-house with a cement yard out the front, almost identical to the one we're sitting in now. You know the type, you see them all over the country on the outskirts of towns \u2013 rows and rows of them, street after street, mile after mile. East coast, west coast, north, south, everywhere the same. You could kidnap me from this house right here, blindfold me, dump me in a house in Muar, and I'd wake up in the middle of the night to take a leak and still be able to find the toilet. The second bedroom wasn't big enough to fit anything more than a child's bed, so we used it as a store room. Jenny wasn't ready to have a baby, and neither was I. The way things turned out, thank goodness we didn't \u2013 that's what you're thinking, and I don't blame you.\n\nSometimes, when I was in prison, the image of that tiny room crammed full of boxes and piles of folded clothes came to mind. I imagined clearing out all the junk, bit by bit, until the room was empty. Then I'd paint the walls white and add colourful stencils. A rainbow. The sun and the moon. Some stars. I imagined carrying a baby's cot into the room with Jenny and placing it carefully away from the window. Once I'd gone through all these steps in my head, I'd think: It's just as well we never had a baby.\n\nWhen I was about fourteen or fifteen, I accompanied my mother to Klang on one of her visits to the hospital, and I remember gazing out of the window of the bus as we travelled down that long stretch of road that led into town, flanked for miles by housing estates that had just been built, and I knew \u2013 with the kind of certainty that only a child can possess \u2013 that when I was an adult, that was where I wanted to live. I'd thought for years that it was just a fantasy, but as I arranged a loan from Mr Lai and another one from the bank, I told myself that there was no longer any need to doubt those childhood longings. As an adult, I knew it wasn't anything fancy, but I also knew it was a decent way to start my married life.\n\nAlmost as soon as we moved in, however, I realised just how much a person changes in fifteen years. Maybe it's just living in this country that does this to you \u2013 maybe in Canada or Japan or Texas or places like that, where life doesn't change so fast, people are different. My aspirations had changed \u2013 they had swelled without me even knowing, and were too big for that little house, which was already fifteen, twenty years old. All along the main road, from town to Meru, new housing estates were being built on every spare plot of land, and we could see them from our house, take in all the details of their construction as we drove past. I was embarrassed, almost ashamed, by our house \u2013 a pain exacerbated by Jenny's pretence of hating the new houses we were forced to look at every day. 'Those gardens are too big,' she'd say. 'The people are going to have problems keeping them tidy.' Or, 'The second storey looks too small for a house that size \u2013 the shape is all funny.' Or, 'The fences are too low, I'd be worried about security if I was in their shoes.' Almost every time we drove past a construction site she would find something negative to say about those expensive new houses, as if she would hate to live in any of them \u2013 as if ours was the most wonderful dwelling place in the area.\n\nThings were continuing to go well for me at the farm, and I knew that if I just kept my head down, we'd be OK. At the back of my mind I had Jenny's father's story of humble beginnings turning into a prosperous existence. Imagining simply waking up one day and owning a business \u2013 his progression seemed so natural that I thought it would just happen to me too. To _us_. I was twenty-eight years old, Jenny thirty-one; time was on our side. All we had to do was keep working, and in a few years' time we'd have more money and a bigger house, and then we could start thinking about having children.\n\nI was working longer and longer hours, and sometimes at weekends, in the hope that Mr Lai would reward me with some extra cash at Chinese New Year \u2013 which he did: half a month's salary in fifty-ringgit notes. I wanted a pay rise too, and he kept promising he would do something. 'Ah Hock, if anyone deserves a pay rise it's you,' he'd say from time to time, and I would just shrug my shoulders and carry on with my work, trying to hide the fact that I was excited. But each month I'd check my pay and find that it was still the same. Once he arrived at the farm very late in the day, about 6 p.m., having just driven all the way from Johor, where he'd been trying to raise some business. From the generator block I watched him get out of his car and walk slowly to the office, and when I went in there a little later he was slumped over the table, half-asleep. Without looking up he said, 'I'm too old for this. You're young \u2013 I should give you half the business.'\n\nI was so excited that my journey home that night seemed to take twice as long as usual \u2013 I couldn't wait to get back to tell Jenny what Mr Lai had said. She'd bought some Cantonese fried noodles on the way home from work and was tipping them out from a plastic bag onto a large dish \u2013 we were eating a lot of takeouts at the time, usually quite late, after we got back from work. I said, 'My boss is going to pass half his business to me.' By then she was shaking some chopped green chillies from a sachet into a plastic dish, and didn't seem bothered by what I'd said. She just breathed out \u2013 a kind of a laugh \u2013 and said, 'Let's wait and see.' I wanted to shout, _Can't you see? I'm going to own half of a huge fish farm one day! I'll be a genuine, real-life tycoon!_ But I let it pass, allowing her caution and doubt to hang heavy in our little house until they became real.\n\n_Thundery without rain_. Know what that means? One of the few elegant idioms I remember from school. Means 'empty promises'. That's exactly what they were. Who knows, maybe one day when he was seventy and I was fifty, Mr Lai might have given me half of the business as he had said, but that first mention of it turned out to be the last. After that, zero. Maybe he changed his mind, but he didn't even talk about a pay rise as a kind of compensation. I didn't have the guts to bring it up with him. How could I do it? It wasn't my place to ask \u2013 _paiseh_ , isn't it? I've always been too shy to make a fuss. I was lucky to have a steady job with steady pay. No qualifications, no college diploma, nothing. I couldn't complain.\n\nJenny started working overtime three, four times a week. 'You don't have to,' I told her. 'I can manage.' We were OK, never late with bills, had enough food to eat. I thought we were doing fine.\n\n'Those loans you took out \u2013 we're paying too much,' she said. She didn't feel comfortable with debt, she wanted to be saving money, to start thinking about having a child. I'd come home late and find her sitting at the dining table with her calculator and a mass of bills and bank statements spread out in front of her. In the harsh white light of the fluorescent tube overhead she looked like a ghost that might vanish at any moment. She'd lost weight recently, and her skin was drawn. Sometimes she'd be sitting in front of the computer, playing Tetris, or looking at news of celebrities from Hong Kong, and wouldn't acknowledge me when I walked in. I wanted to hug her, or stand behind her and massage her shoulders while I joked about Andy Lau's perfect face being the result of plastic surgery, and kiss the top of her head. But she wouldn't even turn to look at me, and in the moment of hesitation an invisible curtain fell between us, a small separation, and I'd suddenly be afraid to touch her in case she felt it was inappropriate, given how hard she'd worked all day. I know it sounds stupid \u2013 we were husband and wife, weren't we? But I became aware of a space that belonged only to _her_ and not _us_ , and I didn't want to intrude into it.\n\nI thought: It's the house, this damn old house, starting to disintegrate in ways that other people would probably say were minor, of no importance \u2013 but add all those small things up and they start to weigh down on you until you're powerless. Yes, each little problem was fixable, but together they were overwhelming us. A broken pane in the window ( _Never mind, you can still close it_ ). A section of the metal grille on the front door rusting away and crumbling, actually falling off before our eyes ( _Don't worry, only a cat or a small dog could get in, not even a child robber could squeeze through that_ ). The cracked cistern, the leaky toilet that dripped all night ( _Can still flush, can't it_?).\n\nOne evening I arrived home and kissed Jenny lightly on the cheek. She was lying on the sofa leafing through _Her World_ magazine, half asleep. The TV was on, an old martial arts movie playing, but the volume was turned nearly all the way down, so all I could hear was the short clashing noise of punches and crossed swords. I went to take a shower and noticed a bad smell, which increased to a stench when I opened the bathroom door. The toilet had broken some weeks ago, and wouldn't flush properly. We'd put a plastic pail in the bathroom, half-filled with water, to pour into the toilet after we'd used it, and sometimes it worked well, other times less so. I lifted the seat and saw that the toilet was filled with shit. Light brown, almost yellow, foamy. Flecks of it all over the bowl. I didn't know if the disgust I felt \u2013 the bitter nausea that swelled up inside me, rising into my throat \u2013 I didn't know if it was because of the smell or the sudden sadness I felt, a kind of helplessness standing in front of that pile of excrement. Jenny must have had diarrhoea. Maybe she'd had it all day, and hadn't told me. How could she? She'd been at work, and so had I; we didn't have time to speak to each other. I sluiced the mess away with the water from the bucket and filled it again. Four, five times, and still the water in the toilet was dirty. I tried to fix the flush but it was hopeless \u2013 something in the mechanism was broken beyond repair.\n\nI went back to the living room and held Jenny tightly. She put her arms around me lightly, but it didn't feel like an embrace \u2013 her body was heavy, almost lifeless. She'd had stomach cramps towards the end of her day at work, she told me, and she'd rushed home just in time, before the worst of it started. She'd been vomiting, had thrown up at least five, six times, and then the diarrhoea began. She was so thirsty, her throat burned and her mouth stank from the acid in her stomach that she could taste on her tongue, but she couldn't even hold down a glass of water. Every time she drank a few mouthfuls she would throw it all up again. After a few hours, she didn't even have enough strength to fill the bucket and wash away the worst of the filth.\n\nThe toilet was broken already, it's not your fault, I said. But she just pulled away from me and went to bed.\n\nI sat in the dark watching the near-silent _wuxia_ movie. A woman fighting two men and a woman, three against one. She used one weapon after another, battling away until it broke \u2013 the eighteen forms of Chinese combat. A thought formed in my head: Maybe it _was_ Jenny's fault. If she hadn't got diarrhoea we wouldn't be sleeping next to a bathroom that smelled of shit. We wouldn't have to be reminded of a broken toilet, a broken house. _But it's not her fault, it's not her fault_ , I kept repeating to myself. _Shit happens_. Isn't that what people say in America? Shit happens shit happens shit happens. I whispered the expression to myself, quietly. It was not her fault.\n\nThe next day I picked up a leaflet from the UOB Bank branch down the road, about low-interest home loans. I announced, 'Next year we're moving house.' Jenny was watching _Akademi Fantasia_ on TV while eating pumpkin seeds, cracking them open carefully with her teeth with barely a sound as she stared at a cute Malay girl singing a romantic song.\n\n'Shh. It's Whitney Houston,' she said.\n\n'We should get a new place. Somewhere better.'\n\nStill she didn't look at me. She laughed, but I didn't know if she was laughing at the singing or at me.\n\nA few weeks later she quit her job to start a new line of work: 'MLM'. She explained it to me three, four times, but in the end we both knew that I wouldn't be able to understand exactly how it worked. _Multi-Level Marketing_. That didn't sound like a proper job to me. 'Are you sure it's OK?' I asked.\n\nShe snorted. 'Huh. You men. What kind of question is that? You work on a farm where you don't even wear shoes, but still dare to look down on my work? Always putting me down.'\n\n'I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. I just want to be sure. To be safe. Just in case.'\n\n'In case what? In case I earn so much money I make you feel inadequate?'\n\nI hugged her and told her I hoped her work would be a great success, that she would make a fortune and be able to keep me like a gigolo. She pushed me away gently. ' _Gigolo_?' she laughed. 'You don't have the looks.'\n\nI asked her to explain. Again. I wanted to understand. She sat me down in front of the papers and flow charts she'd laid out on the table and spoke slowly. 'It's a big American company,' she said, pointing to a photo of a sprawling complex of buildings with snow-topped mountains in the background. 'You think they're going to cheat me?' she laughed. 'This isn't some lousy local business that's going to rip you off at any time.' She read from the brochure: ' _Skin-Glo. Founded in 1983 in Colorado._ _Annual turnover, US$1.1 billion_.' There was a diagram in the shape of a pyramid. 'Right now I'm down here, but all I have to do is recruit a few people and I'll move up one step, then another, then one day' \u2013 she traced her finger all the way to the apex of the pyramid \u2013 'that will be me.'\n\n'Soon, right?'\n\n'Maybe. Probably. Ten years. Our children will grow up as rich people.'\n\nShe opened a box of creams and lotions of various sizes \u2013 beauty products that achieved amazing results. 'This one firms your neckline.' She dabbed a little marble of cream on her skin and began to rub it in. 'You see? You apply it like this, it's a special cream that requires a special technique.'\n\n'If I were a customer I'd buy a whole box from you right now.' It was true. She was so convincing I felt that even I could improve my looks just by buying her Skin-Glo products.\n\nThe next few weeks it was as if we were newlyweds again, living a life that was full of promise. I even took a day off work to fix things around the house \u2013 the broken cistern, the loose tiles in the kitchen, the cracked window pane. I bought a new Panasonic water boiler so Jenny could have fresh-brewed tea all day while she worked from home. Often, if I came home early, she would be explaining how Skin-Glo products worked to other people \u2013 ex-colleagues of hers from the supermarket distribution company, or neighbours I recognised but had never taken the time to say hello to. I realised that we'd all been living completely separate lives, each family tucked away in their little two-bedroomed single-storey house, linked to each other by walls less than a foot thick, yet also divided by that same thin layer of brick and cement. All of us just trying to get on with the day-to-day of our lives. And now we were together, in my house, with Jenny serving cups of tea, laughing, as though this was the life we had always been destined to have, filled with people who could become friends. Teenagers just about to start college, old retired uncles and aunties, professional-looking men and women of our age \u2013 they all sat at the table and dabbed creams onto their cheeks. Their eyelids would flutter lightly as they waited for Jenny to spray a fine mist onto their faces. 'Wait for it, relax,' she said \u2013 ' _It'll feel as light as mountain dew!_ ' I loved that expression, even after I'd heard it twenty times. I loved the little sigh of pleasure or the giggle that followed the quick _shh_ of the spray.\n\nShe recruited ten, fifteen, eventually twenty-eight people \u2013 all of them friends now as well as business partners of sorts. I looked at them when I came back from work on the farm \u2013 watched them sitting in the bright glow of the fluorescent light above the dining table, making jokes I didn't quite understand, constructing a glorious world of promise around them. They'd fill in forms, and I'd imagine those pieces of paper making their way across the Pacific Ocean, over mountains, all the way to Colorado. Sometimes I'd think: I don't even know twenty-eight people in the entire world. One day I found a smartly-dressed woman, barely older than me, sitting in our house, sipping coffee from a Starbucks cup. She sat with her back perfectly straight, perched lightly on the edge of the armchair as if reluctant to come into contact with it. She'd driven down from KL and was one of the company's star salespeople, who'd come to congratulate Jenny for all the people she'd recruited (thirty-three and counting).\n\n'Why does she care how many you recruit?' I said when she'd gone.\n\n'My recruits become her recruits. Of course she cares.'\n\n'What? So _you_ recruit for _her_? _She_ gets the money?'\n\n'That's how it works,' Jenny said as she turned on the TV. 'If my recruits hire more people, they become mine.'\n\n'And then they all belong to that woman?'\n\nJenny laughed at something on the TV \u2013 a game show with people hitting each other with bouncy-foam sausages. 'She has _thirteen thousand_ salespeople below her.' As if that explained everything.\n\nI couldn't stand the idea of a woman in KL making so much money from all the time Jenny was spending with people she barely knew \u2013 all the nights that we could and should have been going out to the movies, driving to dinner at a seafood place on the coast. All the things we'd once shared, not so long ago. But I said nothing, I didn't understand the way these things worked. _Shit happens_. The words came to me, forming in my head like thunderclouds, and I tried to stifle them quickly. Everything would work out.\n\nFrom time to time Jenny would show me a text message from the woman in KL, a line of encouragement. _The only person who can stop you is YOU. Go for it! Jia you!_ Sometimes she'd show me a photo of the woman posing in various locations \u2013 Hong Kong airport, Vancouver airport, in front of Big Ben in London, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and other places I'd never heard of. Jenny had bought a new phone, a Samsung, one of the first that could receive photos, a square blur of colour that didn't mean anything to me. At home she started following this woman \u2013 who she called her 'mentor' \u2013 on the internet, and spent long hours staring at the computer screen, scrolling through pages of photos of things that seemed unconnected, to me at least. Cars. Beauty salons. Fast trains in Japan. A hot-air balloon over African plains. A gym in Los Angeles. When I asked about them she replied, 'It's work.'\n\nI'd come home in the evening and she'd be in front of the computer, so I'd eat dinner on my own, quickly, trying to avoid the feeling of being cut off from her even in our own house. We went to bed at separate hours, woke up at different times. I barely even noticed that she was receiving fewer and fewer new business contacts, or that the boxes of Skin-Glo products stacked up along the wall remained unopened. I asked her once how it was going, whether she'd made a lot of recruits recently, and she started shouting at me. Why was I always trying to criticise her? Why couldn't I understand anything? Why was I so ignorant and low-class? Why couldn't I get some education so that I could figure out complicated things in life?\n\nIt was true, I didn't understand complex arrangements for business, I couldn't figure out how Jenny's line of work was profitable. But there were more straightforward things I could work out. I asked Mr Lai for a loan, and added the money to my savings, which made me appear better-off than I actually was, so the bank lent me more money to buy a new house in Taman Bestari \u2013 three bedrooms, a garden at the front and a small concrete yard at the back, in an area that had only been developed a few months previously. No one had lived in it before, and it gave me a sense of freedom: in the space and light of this new house I was going to become someone different \u2013 someone better. The smell of glue and paint and cement, the powdery feel of concrete dust that covered every surface \u2013 all that seemed thrilling, but also reassuring, as though the place had always been destined to be mine. Someone had built this house just for us.\n\nFor a while I thought the house had saved us. Jenny used one of the bedrooms as an office, her computer set up on a desk on one side of the room, the screen always on, flickering and colourful even late at night as I walked past the door just before bedtime. She started inviting people over to the house for Skin-Glo meetings once more.\n\nWe carried on this way, each of us working at our jobs, our separate lives, until it all seemed normal, not even worthy of comment \u2013 by me or by her.\n\nAnd then Keong rang me at the farm and came back into my life.\n\n##\n\nI recognise the tune she's humming, but I can't remember where it's from. Just a few notes, repeated on and off throughout the morning, whenever we take a break.\n\nWhat's that song?\n\nHuh? Oh. She laughs. It's nothing. An advert on TV, I think.\n\nYou had a good week?\n\nI guess so. Actually, yes.\n\nShe looks at her papers and puts the phone down, ready to record our conversation, but she doesn't press the bright red button to start the way she usually does. Maybe I should ask her more questions, but I remember what she's always saying: We're here for _your_ story.\n\nWhat have you been up to? I ask after a long pause.\n\nOh, this and that. I mean, it's been very busy. Lots going on.\n\nLike what?\n\nI went on the Bersih march. You know, the anti-corruption demonstration. Felt I needed to be in the streets, physically protesting against the government and not just observing and writing.\n\nSure, I saw it on Facebook.\n\nIt was such an incredible atmosphere. So many people on the streets. Tens and tens of thousands. Maybe even a hundred thousand. I was standing on the overhead bridge outside Masjid Jamek and I couldn't see a single square foot of empty road. Every street was crammed full of protestors. I've never felt such excitement in my life. It was as though people were breathing each other's optimism. There was anger too, don't get me wrong. But it all mixed into a weird kind of energy, as if the air in KL was carrying an electrical charge, like it does during a lightning storm, when everything feels dangerous and unstable, but also, I don't know, alive with the possibility of change. It felt as if every political structure in the country, every outmoded social custom, can be torn down, and that was like, wow, scary, but also just so damn exhilarating. Every so often there'd be a small cheer, some people making a rallying cry, and then their voices would gather more voices around them, and more and more, and you'd hear this wave of voices swelling and growing, moving through the crowd, just like an angry sea. A tsunami. People would start chanting around me, and I'd join them without even thinking. Late in the afternoon, standing in the crowd in front of Public Bank, I've never had such an extraordinary feeling of belonging to something bigger than just myself or my family. Something that stood for change. For the betterment of society.\n\nWere the police there?\n\nOf course. Dozens and dozens, everywhere. Armed policemen, and drones overhead taking pictures. And some pro-government supporters too, trying to intimidate us.\n\nYou weren't scared? I mean, you're young.\n\nYou mean, was I scared because I'm a woman? Of course not! At least half the people there were women. There were entire women's groups out there, all kinds of people. Old, young, rich, poor. I was next to a group of old Chinese aunties from Kepong. They were all wearing baseball caps, and when the police drones flew overhead they said, Hey miss, hide your face! And they all pulled cloths over their mouths and noses. They knew the drones were taking photos. They were carrying backpacks with little bottles of water, in case of tear gas. They'd been there before. It was amazing.\n\nYou're very brave.\n\nIt's got nothing to do with bravery. It's about changing our country. Making the world a better place for everyone, regardless of race or religion.\n\nYou make it sound like a big party. I wish I could have been there. But my legs, my body... I don't know if I could have made it through the day.\n\nIt was a fight, not a party. We're all fighting, remember. For something better.\n\nYou really think things will change?\n\nOf course. Why else would I have gone?\n\nSometimes we act because we have no choice. Especially nowadays.\n\nHmmm. She nods and tilts her head, as if she's about to disagree with what I said, only she doesn't. Well, she says. Let's see what happens. Politics is crazy right now, anything can happen. Even me and my friends, we argue about stuff all the time. I had some people over for a housewarming party the other night, we just sat among all the boxes and ate pizza, drank wine. And guess what? People started arguing! I guess we were all still pumped up about the demonstrations. Someone said something, someone else took offence. It was nuts. We're all supposed to be friends.\n\nYou moved house?\n\nYeah. Crazy time to move, huh? It was time, though.\n\nTime for what?\n\nShe pauses, and her smile tightens. I get the feeling I've asked her too much, and now she feels that she's said too much, that she shouldn't be telling me things about herself. Maybe she's afraid of telling me where she lives, what her family does.\n\nTime to make a commitment, she says at last. I thought, well, it's as good a time as any to move in with my, my partner. She hesitates, as if she's searching for the right word. _Airen_. My sweetheart. We've been seeing each other for a while now, and it gets to the point where you either commit or separate. So, we committed!\n\nCongratulations, I'm happy for you.\n\nThank you. It's only been a few days, but I'm enjoying the experience so far.\n\nWhen are you getting married?\n\nYou must be joking! It's too early for that. Anyway, I don't believe that two people need to marry in order to live together.\n\nDon't talk nonsense, of course you do. Besides, if your _airen_ doesn't marry you, another man will steal you away sooner or later.\n\nActually, she says. She holds my eye without blinking. Actually, my partner is a woman.\n\nOh. A woman.\n\nYes.\n\nI'm sorry. I didn't know.\n\nShe laughs and opens her folder, leaning forward to check her phone. It's absolutely fine. But in the future, it might be better not to make assumptions about people's sexuality based on traditional gender lines.\n\nI nod. I'm really sorry.\n\nOh, it's fine. Now, shall we begin?\n\n##\n\n_October 24th_\n\nI had never seen the other man before that night. He wasn't one of the migrants who drifted in from the plantations seeking work along the coast. You saw them often, skinny red-eyed Bangladeshis with patches of skin on their arms and faces rubbed raw from all the pesticides they sprayed. Always on the move. Always giving the impression they were in search of something, yet always slow in their movements, as if the air around them had turned to water and they were wading through the world. Swim-walking. The oxygen sucked out of their world so they were forever in motion, but never making progress.\n\nThat man, the one who waited for Keong and me on the riverbank that night, he didn't have the same restlessness as the others. He was Bangladeshi too. You already know that, you've read the court documents, done your research \u2013 but that's all you've got. Where he came from, maybe his name, age \u2013 nothing else. You might have seen a photo, the one he used on his identity card, the same one that supplied you his name. _Mohammad Ashadul_. I heard that name only once, in court. I'm surprised I remember it. The rest of the time he was referred to only as _the victim_ , or _the deceased_ , in public and in private. My lawyer, the prosecutors \u2013 they never used his name, so I'm not sure why I remember it.\n\nNowadays I'll often come across news reports on Facebook about men and women who die the way he did, and always they're just called 'a 33-year-old Bangladeshi man', or 'a 28-year-old Myanmar national', or 'a 40-year-old Indonesian female'. Maybe that's why the man's name lodged in my head \u2013 because all the time I spent hearing him being discussed in front of me, I remembered the way he stood, his feet planted widely apart so that he seemed solid and unmoving, unlike the other foreign workers. Rooted to the earth, that's how he seemed. As much a part of the landscape as the trees around us. He wasn't going anywhere. The sharp smile on his face. His watch that glinted in the dark. The way he addressed me as _brother_ \u2013 the single English word that popped up amid his broken Malay. The surprising warmth of his laughter.\n\nThese are details about the man that you cannot possibly know. You, the police, the lawyers, the judge, the jury \u2013 no one knew, and no one asked. But I knew. And that's why his name has stuck in my memory all these years, because I thought: My friend, you and I, we're pretty similar after all. Your name has been forgotten, just as mine will be very soon. I, at least, have existed for a brief moment, a few days when my name has been hauled from the shadows and repeated in public, but in less than a week I'll disappear too. I'll have a prison number, and the photo they'll take of me will make me look just like any other small-time Chinese gangster, a _dim sum_ waiter who made a couple of bad choices. There are lots of us. I know that from the time I've already spent in the lock-up. My name will become irrelevant, just as it was before the trial, before the killing, and I will vanish, just like you.\n\n_Mohammad Ashadul._ Who knows if that was his real name? Who knows if his identity card was genuine? It probably wasn't, because that was his line of work, faking ICs and passports. If you can print fifty counterfeit cards a day, you can print one for yourself, that's for sure. You can say anything you want on the card. You can add the right digits to your IC number so that when the police stop you and check your details, you have a convincing explanation for your accent, your limited Malay vocabulary. I saw them all the time at the farm \u2013 61, 62, 64, 68, 79. Especially 61 and 79. Indonesia and Bangladesh. You see those numbers, you know where the person was born. We're not talking about those flimsy temporary foreign worker cards that migrants are supposed to have \u2013 those are worthless. No one needs them. What I'm talking about is fake ICs that look exactly like the genuine ones you and I have. Pay the right guy enough money and you can get one. Or maybe you've married a local girl and got yourself an IC. Who knows. All I know was that guy was in the business of running cards, and in the days leading up to that evening, I never heard a single person refer to him by the name I heard in court. _Mr B_ , _Bobby_ , _the boss_ \u2013 that was what people called him. Keong called him _sei hak gwai_. If you understand Cantonese you can translate that yourself. It was hard to know who Keong was talking about, because he often called dark-skinned people that name. That was what he was like. [ _Shakes his head; laughs_.] Or maybe Mohammad Ashadul _was_ his real name. All I'm saying is that you can't trust what you read on a piece of paper.\n\nThat was why we were going to see him \u2013 to sort out some paperwork. That's what Keong said. He laughed when he said it. 'It's like office work. I just need to sort out some problems.'\n\n'What kind of problems?'\n\nHe laughed.\n\nEven at that point, when I knew why Keong had come back to Klang, I didn't think things would turn out the way they did. He arrived in town about three months before that evening. He'd sent a few texts after he rang me at the farm \u2013 cheerful notes just to say _Hi, what're you doing today_. _Damn I can't wait to finish work and go home_. _Screw it the rain is just too bad today_. The type of message you send your best friend, someone you see every other day, who knows the pattern of your days and understands how you might feel early in the morning, or after a long day \u2013 not someone you haven't seen in years, someone with whom you've had no contact at all, with whom you share nothing apart from a couple of teenage years, when you were no longer boys but not yet men. When you didn't really know who you were, and were trying to figure out how to live. In the span of someone's entire life, that period amounts to little more than a few heartbeats \u2013 a time that means nothing. _Weather today reminds me of being back in our village_. Whenever I got a text like that from Keong, I thought, You kidding? Surely that time of your life doesn't mean anything to you now. He'd only spent a year and a half there. Now he was thirty-two years old, but still referring to things that happened half his lifetime before.\n\nI didn't know how to reply to the messages. A guy like Keong turns up after nearly a decade's silence, what am I supposed to feel? I should have been happy, I guess, or at least relieved to know that he was safe and healthy. When someone disappears like that, as Keong had all those years before, it's only natural to be concerned. But instead I felt a numbness that spread through my thoughts and even the muscles in my body, as if I'd been bitten by a sea snake. Back in the village, people often got into trouble with snakes. They get tangled up in the nets, and when you try to free them, sometimes you get bitten. Unlike with land snakes or stone fish or urchins, a sea snake's bite doesn't swell up. No agonising pain, almost nothing at all to begin with. But later your head starts to ache, you feel your throat tightening, your breathing slowing down, your muscles refusing to obey your commands \u2013 a paralysis that overcomes you so slowly you barely realise it's happening. I saw this happening to people from the village, watched them succumb slowly to the venom as they were taken to the hospital \u2013 it looked as though their bodies were turning against themselves.\n\nOnce I got bitten myself \u2013 a flash of black and white stripes striking out from the mass of writhing silver fish; the dull ache spreading from my leg to the rest of me; the world turning into a place I couldn't control. And then \u2013 after a few minutes, half an hour, who knows? I really can't remember \u2013 it was over. It turned out that the snake hadn't released any venom. I'd been lucky. Who knows why that particular snake chose not to poison me that day. But my body had prepared itself for the shock, and started to sink into that unfeeling, unthinking state in order to protect itself. The body learns from what it observes. It remembers. It anticipates.\n\nWhen I answered the phone that first day when Keong rang the farm, I just stood there saying nothing, just listening to his voice, as energetic and cigarette-rough as it had always been. I was remembering what it was like to be with him, and maybe I was already defending myself. My body knew how to produce sounds: _Yes, en, really, ya see you soon_. I thought he'd understand that I wasn't keen on seeing him again, that my lack of joy would mean something to him \u2013 but he didn't. I'd never been one to say much, and he probably thought I hadn't changed at all.\n\nAs that strange dull fatigue took hold of me, I thought of Jenny. I thought of her sitting at the computer in our new house, sending emails to customers, making calls to people across the country, all the way to Sabah, even Singapore. Behind her, the sofa still covered in plastic to protect it from the last of the dust left behind from the construction work. The pure white walls, slightly chalky to the touch. The faint smell of paint and glue that we both found intoxicating. The sheen of the terrazzo floors. The certainty of things. We'd sometimes plug in our mobile phones to charge them even when we didn't really need to, and we'd joke that we missed trying to guess whether the socket would work, as we had done in our previous house, or whether the fusebox would trip when we turned the switch on. I'd turn on the lights in the kitchen and still be amazed that the bulbs underneath the cupboards on the wall glowed gently, just like the small glass dome on the ceiling. Jenny would laugh and say that I preferred the harsh light of the fluorescent strips that we had in the old house, that I couldn't see things clearly without that kind of low-class lighting. In the evenings, just before going upstairs to bed, I'd see her in front of the TV with a cup of _leung cha_ , or spooning some _gui ling gou_ out of a jar she'd bought at her favourite place in Jusco Mall. She seemed so settled in that spot that I never thought of asking her to join me in bed so we might fall asleep together, or make love, or talk \u2013 none of those things was more important to her than her place on that sofa. To disturb her space would be to destroy everything, for her and for us. Our house was new, it would last many years, maybe a lifetime, and in it we had found \u2013 quickly, so quickly \u2013 a way to live that would not be troubled by anything.\n\nDuring that first phone call, Keong asked for my mobile number, and I gave it to him, not thinking that he'd ever use it. And if he did, I could simply not respond. That was what happened for two, maybe three weeks \u2013 every time I received one of his chatty meaningless texts I'd just delete it. But still, I'd feel the numbness start to creep into my body whenever I saw his number pop up on the screen of my phone. When the texts started to arrive more or less daily, I'd feel a kind of ache in my stomach every time I reached for my phone, wondering if I'd find a message from him. I knew I'd soon have to decide what to do. Ask him politely to go away. Tell him to fuck off. Meet him and have a Kopi-O and a stilted conversation so both of us could see once and for all that we had nothing in common \u2013 that I'd changed, that I was a different person. Tell him that my wife didn't like me getting texts from people she didn't know. Change my number. Take some of the boys from work to meet him and beat him up. Kick him until he was black and blue and half-conscious, just as I'd seen him doing to others when we were young. The options ran through my mind constantly, until I couldn't concentrate on anything else. ' _Wai_ , people are talking to you, dickhead!' Mr Lai shouted one day at work. 'Anyone at home there?' I'd been looking at him, nodding, but in fact I was thinking of my phone, clipped to my belt. It had just beeped twice, indicating a new text message.\n\nWhat do you think I did? Of all the solutions available to me \u2013 some good, some bad, some complicated, others simple \u2013 I chose the worst. But when you have to make a decision like that, sometimes the most rotten choice, the one that everyone else knows will lead to disaster \u2013 that path seems the most sensible to you. Or maybe it only seems that way because you don't actually have a choice. Perhaps there's only one true way forward. All the others are false paths, illusions that exist only to give you the impression of freedom of choice. No one can alter the course of things. Your karma is set, it determines everything. I'd never believed in anything like that before \u2013 all the temples and prayers and amulets in my childhood, they proved nothing to me. But when I was in prison a few months later, I began to realise that it was all true. The joss-sticks and the offerings to the gods were a recognition of life's inevitability. Those attempts to appease the gods were our way of acknowledging our helplessness. We were trying to soften the rougher edges of our fate, but really we knew that nothing would truly change. If your boat was going to capsize, it was going to capsize. Your death in the storm was predetermined. God wanted it to be so. You could have stayed home that day, but you decided to go to sea, because it was the only thing you could do. Likewise, when I rang Keong, the choice had already been made for me.\n\nOf course, that wasn't what went through my head the day I decided to meet him. My thinking was simple. I'd meet him out of respect for an old friendship. Village ties. The spirit of clans. It wasn't so much that I had to give him face, it was because I had to respect customs. Someone from your old village resurfaces in your life, you treat them to dinner. I guess I'm very traditional in that respect. I don't know what it's like to turn my back on someone from my past, who knew my mother, whose mother fed me when I was hungry. No matter how difficult the experience of meeting Keong might be, I would do what was expected of me by suggesting that we meet, and he would recognise that I was merely fulfilling an obligation. We'd chat about life, quickly run out of things to say, and finally try to end our meeting as soon as possible.\n\nMore importantly, he would realise that I had changed, was no longer the person he knew, and maybe when he heard about my achievements since we last met on the streets of Puchong, he'd feel chastened, embarrassed by his own lack of success. He'd think, Why am I still scratching around in the dirt like a skinny chicken looking for worms, when I could be a cow eating grass like Ah Hock? Our meeting would be an awkward experience for him, even more than it was for me, and he would be the one to say, It's getting late, I have to go now. And he'd never contact me again. He'd see that the brief bond we'd shared in our teenage years and early adulthood amounted to nothing, that we were different people now, worlds apart.\n\nThat was the choice I made.\n\nWe met at Ah Chan's on Jalan Meru, a place I often used to stop at for dinner on my own before heading home, especially when I knew Jenny was having people over for one of her work gatherings, when they'd try out the latest products that had arrived from America, and discuss the various strategies they'd employ to sell them. They'd started to drink wine with the snacks they ate while they were chatting, and sometimes when I arrived home the house would be filled with voices as bright and clear as the clinking of their glasses. They'd smile at me as I walked in, and Jenny would wave from across the room, but their conversation would barely pause. I felt as if my presence was an intrusion, and it was safer to keep out of their world.\n\nAh Chan's place was set back from the main road into town, and although it was covered with a zinc roof it had no walls, so the rush of traffic was always present \u2013 a constant dull river of sound that I found comforting after a day at the farm, with its unsettling noises. The bark of men's voices, shouting, always shouting. The grinding of machinery. Even water, when it crashed down onto the planks of wood, had a jagged quality to it.\n\nAh Chan herself \u2013 in her sixties, with long, neat pure-silver hair \u2013 never spoke loudly. She talked to everyone \u2013 whether to me or the other customers or Hayati, the Indonesian helper who'd been with her for twenty years \u2013 in little more than a murmur. She and Hayati had got to know me over time, and I liked chatting to them. Hayati even spoke some Hokkien from working with Ah Chan. Can you believe that? We'd make jokes in our dialect that you wouldn't be able to understand. Sometimes, if it was raining hard and there were no other customers, they'd sit with me, drinking tea while I ate my _bak kut teh_. They asked about Jenny as if they knew her \u2013 how was her business, was she was eating well \u2013 but in fact Jenny had never been there, not even once. They'd tell me about their lives \u2013 back then Ah Chan was worried about her son in KL, who'd just lost his job because his factory was closing down and moving operations to Suzhou in China. She was hoping he'd move back to be close to her in Klang, but suspected that he'd leave the country altogether and look for work in China or Australia. He wanted to be successful, he told her, he didn't want to work in a factory any more. And Hayati, who'd just got divorced but was happier than she'd ever been. Dumped her cheating asshole husband in Bandung when she'd last gone home and found out that he was having an affair with another woman. Living in a house that they'd built with Hayati's money \u2013 all the cash she earned working a thousand miles from home. What do you expect, he'd said. You're away for so long, what am I supposed to do? I expect you to get out of my life and never come back, she replied. Now she had her entire month's salary to herself, didn't have to send anything back to that bastard. She could spend it how she wanted. Men, she said. No point relying on them \u2013 in this life, you gotta do everything yourself.\n\n'You sure you don't want to find another one?' I sometimes asked. 'Now that you're single again.'\n\n'Find me a man who's not a liar and a cheat and I'll marry him straight away!'\n\nA few times, when it was clear that no one else would be turning up because of the bad weather, they'd close early. They'd leave me a couple of portions of leftover soup to take back to Jenny, and turn off all the lights before making their way home. But I'd sit there in the half-dark for a while longer, listening to the drumming of the rain on the roof that drowned out the noise of the traffic. The headlamps of the cars sparkling in gloom and mist, the water coursing along the open drains nearby. I'd feel like staying there all night.\n\nRecently, just a few months ago, I went back to Ah Chan's after many years, and only Hayati recognised me. Ah Chan did not. 'Auntie! It's me, Auntie,' I said, but she just smiled briefly before looking away. At first I thought she might be going senile. She didn't look any older, but it had been such a long time since my last visit, it wouldn't have been surprising for her to have started losing her memory. Then I thought, maybe she'd heard about what I'd done, and didn't want to talk to me. That must have been it \u2013 there was no other explanation. Hayati said, 'It's been a long time,' but she too was subdued, distracted by the bubbling pots and the other customers who were calling for her. She didn't try to exchange any words with me, didn't smile when she walked past. I thought of asking how she was, whether she'd been back to Indonesia recently, whether she'd remarried \u2013 but I didn't. Couldn't. I finished my meal and left as quickly as I could. Didn't even wait for my change. I've never gone back.\n\nAh Chan didn't warm to Keong when we met there that first time. He looked much the same as he had nearly a decade earlier, only even skinnier, with dark rings under his eyes, his complexion slightly grey and powdery. Cheeks sunken. The long wispy ends of his hair, both front and back, were dyed coppery orange, just as they had been all those years before. But his clothes were smarter \u2013 a proper short-sleeved shirt, open at the neck to show off a gold chain, trousers with creases pressed down the front, and black leather shoes that made a clicking sound on the concrete as he approached. I thought, Those must have cost a lot.\n\nHe was talking before he even sat down, as though he was just picking up a conversation we'd recently had somewhere else. 'Klang traffic is crazy these days, I'm so stressed. They finish the new flyover then close it again after two weeks. Fuck. Why aren't you drinking beer? Hey Auntie, give us two beers, please. Carlsberg. What the hell, this place doesn't even serve beer, meh? Fuck. Life these days \u2013 everything costs so much. Alcohol licence, health and safety licence, even soy sauce. People can't run a decent restaurant any more. Look at this place. Poor bastards. How's anyone supposed to make a living when the price of petrol goes up all the time? That's what it's all about, you know. Oil. The moment there's a war in the Middle East, the garlic gets more expensive in Sekinchan.'\n\nHayati brought me my usual order. 'Same for your friend?'\n\nKeong waved her away. 'No, I don't want to eat here. I'll get something later. I just need a beer. Can't eat without beer in my stomach.' He laughed, and started playing with the piles of small plastic sauce dishes on the table, arranging them into separate stacks. 'How was your day, anyway? All OK at work?' Just the sort of question he'd have asked when we were hanging round the streets of Puchong ten years back, drifting in and out of work. A lifetime ago.\n\nWork? I thought. You don't know what I do for work, you don't know anything about me. 'Yes, all OK.'\n\n'That's all we can ask for in life. That things are OK.'\n\nHe talked all the time I was eating \u2013 he had an opinion on everything. Whether the government was going to rig the elections. Buddhist monks on the streets in Myanmar. Plainclothes police at Suria KLCC Mall. The price of wheat in Australia. Whether Andy Lau was better than Louis Koo in _Prot\u00e9g\u00e9_. The shooting in Virginia, USA. Things I didn't know about, and wasn't interested in. I finished my meal as quickly as I could, and when I signalled to Hayati that I wanted to pay, Keong reached into his pocket and eased out a thick bunch of hundred-ringgit notes, tightly folded and held together with a rubber band. He peeled one away from the others and let it fall to the table without interrupting his constant stream of talk. I looked at the wad of cash in his hand. He wore three rings on each hand.\n\n'Got anything smaller?' Hayati asked.\n\nHe shook his head. 'Don't worry, if you don't have change you can just pay me back later. Take a small loan.'\n\nI stood up and gave Hayati the right amount of money. As I made to leave, Ah Chan called out to me. She was holding a bag containing some soup and a small portion of rice, neatly tied up with pink raffia string. She had her own special way of tying up those takeaway servings, a double loop that came undone with a small tug, unlike the messy knots other people did. 'For your wife,' she said. 'With extra ribs as usual.' She turned away quickly without waiting for thanks.\n\n'Where're we going now?' Keong said.\n\n'I'm going home,' I replied.\n\n'Come on, brother! I only just got here, we need to catch up on old times! I know a couple of places in town, people know me, we'll get free drinks. It'll be fun. Just a couple of hours. It's not even eight o'clock yet.'\n\nI looked at my watch. Jenny's gathering at home would most likely still be going on. I could maybe have a beer, just one, with Keong, and then he'd go away and leave me alone. I rang Jenny and heard laughter \u2013 hers and others' \u2013 Jenny saying to someone, _We already knew that, sweetheart,_ followed by more laughter before she finally came on the phone. 'Hello? Umm, yes, no problem. We'll be here a bit longer, take your time.'\n\nThe line went dead before I could say, Don't worry, I won't be late.\n\nSometimes I wonder how the last nine or ten years would have played out if Jenny had said simply, 'You joking? Come home right now, you good-for-nothing man. Call yourself a husband!' Perhaps I would have bought the farm from Mr Lai a few years later, and although it would have been tough at first, I'd just be starting to turn a profit now, with all the investment in new machinery finally paying off \u2013 big money coming in right at this point in time. You and me sitting here, my business growing even as we spoke. You'd be interviewing me not as a forgotten criminal with a little forgotten life, but as a successful figure in society. Jenny and I would have had children, we'd have plans for them. I'd be asking your advice about how best to have them educated \u2013 in one of those fancy international schools in Kuala Lumpur that I read about, or maybe boarding school abroad. I'd ask you tons of questions about New York, whether you enjoy being there \u2013 questions about your studies, what you eat, the weather. Things that would be of interest to rich people. Just think of it \u2013 that might have been what we'd be talking about. But these matters are of no relevance to me now, and we're talking about different things \u2013 about regret. And I'm sure you're thinking: There's no point dwelling on what might have been, because this is my life, my fate.\n\nThat first night with Keong, I never thought about how things might turn out \u2013 how could I? All the days that followed, it never occurred to me that things would end so badly. Not even on the night we met Mohammad Ashadul. Driving up to the spot near the riverbank, I still thought I was just helping out a friend who had some problems, and the sooner they were sorted out, the sooner he'd disappear from my life and things would continue as before. Even when Keong and Ashadul started to raise their voices, I never felt that my life was going to change. When Keong started jabbing his finger in Ashadul's face, I thought, It's a small fight, it's nothing. The whole scene seemed so distant from my life, or at least the one I'd built for myself in my head. The two of them standing in the near-darkness, shouting at each other. Keong moving closer to the Bangladeshi guy until he's shouting in his face. Ashadul rooted to the ground, not backing off. Feet planted, solid as a tree trunk. Taking a drag on his cigarette. When he shouts back at Keong small wisps of smoke appear in the dark like threads of silver. He looks away and spits on the ground. Keong lunges at him. Doesn't punch him, slaps him. With one hand the other guy strikes out and knocks Keong to the ground \u2013 the other hand still holds his cigarette, so delicately that he looks like an actor in a movie. Keong lies there, suddenly silent. He's been taken by surprise by the swiftness of the man's retaliation. Keong has a knife. I've seen it. A switchblade he bought in Hatyai recently, 'in case of an emergency'. But he's lying on the ground, he's fallen in an awkward position, the knife is lost in the undergrowth. The other man turns to face me. He's short, powerfully built, with a moustache that even in the dark appears neatly trimmed. He takes half a step towards me \u2013 no, actually he's steadying himself on the muddy grass. I'm on the ground too. How did this happen \u2013 why am I surrounded by a tangle of branches and leaves? He reaches into his pocket and takes out a switchblade that looks very much like Keong's. The noise the blade makes as it flicks sharply into the night is smooth, almost comforting, not at all alarming. He turns to face Keong squarely. And it's in that brief pause that I notice I have a piece of wood in my hand. As I stand up I think, It feels very light.\n\n## II\n\n## NOVEMBER\n\n##\n\n_November 2nd_\n\nMy father left for Singapore when I was four years old. Of course I can't remember anything about his departure, though over the years I've convinced myself that I was witness to certain things that happened on the day he left. For example: that he left his bus ticket in the kitchen and had to rush back to get it, but when he got home my mother had already gone to work, and he had to break into the house to retrieve it. It was late at night, my mother had just started a job as a cleaner at a fish wholesaler down the road, and I'd been asleep for a few hours. When my father broke the latch on the window it disturbed the dog in the yard next door, which began to bark. It was a thin mongrel the colour of sand, old and half-blind, and maybe because it was slow and couldn't see anything it got spooked easily and barked at the slightest movement. I remember that dog well, eyes like glass marbles that seemed as though they could pop out of their sockets at any moment. I woke up and started to cry in the dark. My father came into the bedroom to comfort me, but he knew that if he picked me up and held me until I was calm again he'd miss the bus, and all his chances of decent work and money would disappear, and he'd have to go back to gutting fish at the factory on the other side of Kuala Selangor.\n\nIt was raining heavily. The sound of the rain drumming on the tin roof, normally so soothing, agitated me that night, and I sat up in bed, blinking and sobbing in the dark. Outside: the barking dog, the yard turning to mud. My father stood in the doorway, staring at me. He'd been caught in the rain; his clothes were dripping and left patches of water on the linoleum that my mother would find when she came home some hours later. He'd been in a hurry, he hadn't had time to take his shoes off, and had ended up leaving muddy tracks all over the floor. He stood watching me for a while, then left. The sound of my crying followed him out of the house, all the way into the rainstorm as he boarded the night bus headed south.\n\nI wish I could say that I remember him standing in the doorway, or that I could hear his breathing, heavy and rushed because he'd been running. But the likelihood is that I started to cry because I had a bad dream, and only woke up for a few seconds before falling asleep again. It must have been one of those nightmares that only children have, where sleep and awakeness and dreaminess and reality get entangled before evaporating into a cloud that hangs over them for hours, so that even when they're awake, they're really still asleep, still dreaming. You and I \u2013 we don't have this muddle. Everything is distinct. Work time. Play time. Eat time. Sleep time. I don't know how this change takes place in someone's life, but it does, overnight, and they don't even know it. I'm not sure how it happened with me \u2013 I just woke up one morning and thought, _Hurry up, it's time for work now._ I was fifteen years old. And that beautiful cloudiness on waking from slumber that I remembered from my childhood, sometimes sad, sometimes comforting \u2013 it had just vanished.\n\nThe story of my father coming home in the rainstorm to retrieve his bus ticket was told and retold to me by my mother numerous times over the years, until the image of him that evening became so sharp and true that I believed I'd seen him myself. She repeated the story so often that I thought: She wants me to believe that he cared for me. I cried, he wavered. Back then we still believed that he would be coming home to us, and when he did we would have more money and life would be easier. My parents were still in contact, on a more or less regular basis. A letter would arrive from Singapore from time to time, a single sheet of thin paper with a rough edge where it had been torn from a notebook. He could at least have bought decent paper to write on. My mother would read the few lines so intently you'd think it was the _I-Ching_ or some special advice sent to her by Confucius himself. Sometimes she'd read just one line aloud, slowly and seriously, like a newsreader announcing a headline. _Singapore is Very Clean_. Or, _Here, Spitting is Not Allowed_. Or, _No One Has to Pay Bribes Here_. I have no idea what else he wrote to her in those letters \u2013 everything was just condensed into those single lines, like a public-service announcement.\n\nA few times we walked to Ah Heng's sundry store half a mile away to wait for a phone call from my father, which I guess he must have promised in a previous letter. Only the call never came. Who knows why \u2013 maybe he had to line up for too long to use the phone at the warehouse where he worked, or maybe he had to work overtime, or maybe he just forgot. How did people live without mobiles? It feels like only yesterday, but life was so different. It seems strange now to think about how much time we wasted at Ah Heng's place. Hours and hours hanging around for that call that never came.\n\nTo hide the embarrassment and pain of that fruitless waiting, my mother pretended that we'd needed to come to the shop to buy things. I'd sit on the sacks of rice, filling the time by memorising the way the various things were arranged on the shelves, then closing my eyes and reciting them until I got the order right. _Mumm 21. Shelltox. Maggi Mee Perencah Kari_. There was never very much stock, and what there was never changed position \u2013 biscuits, nappies, flour. Everything stayed where it was, covered in a thin film of dust. If I close my eyes now I can see every single object on those metal shelves, and I bet if you went there tomorrow, they'd still all be there, arranged in exactly the order I've told you.\n\nMy mother would chat to Ah Heng about all sorts of things, giving him news about my father, which wasn't actually news because it was the same set of things repeated every time: he had a new job, he was sending money home, he would come back soon and we would either build ourselves a new house somewhere in the Sekinchan area or move to Klang. Either way, we would stop living in that house \u2013 half-wood, half-cement \u2013 because the wood was rotting and my mother was tired of patching up the gaps between the planks with pieces of biscuit tins that she flattened out with a hammer. She spent a lot of time doing this, but new holes were always appearing \u2013 spots of white light, brilliant as stars. She couldn't keep up with them; nature was stronger than she was. We had to move. I would need my own room, I couldn't go on sharing with my parents. With my _father-mother_. She spoke as if we were a family, a normal, proper family, because that's what we were in her head and in mine, and probably in Ah Heng's and everyone else's too. When she talked about the life we were going to have, it all made sense. It seemed connected to where I was, sitting on the sacks of rice; it was part of the same story, a story of waiting, of waiting for things to get better, because they would. We all thought we knew how the story would turn out, because why would it turn out any other way? My father was in Singapore, he was earning a decent wage in a warehouse in a country that had rules about employment, where he got paid in full on the same day each month \u2013 a detail that seems small and irrelevant as I talk about it now, but back then seemed so important to us that we boasted about it. _Every month, without fail \u2013 no arguing, nothing \u2013 he gets his salary_. I can remember my mother saying that to Ah Heng one day.\n\nOf course it was all fake. Our lives weren't getting any better. If they were, we would have been buying more than just a packet of cornflour or a single coconut which Ah Heng would split in two and scrape out in his old machine with its big metal bowl and spinning metal head. We would have been buying tins of Danish Butter Cookies, going out for meals in seafood restaurants, I would have had a new school uniform that fitted me, that wasn't four sizes too big because it had been bought to last me through the rest of primary school. Maybe a holiday \u2013 not anything fancy like a week all-included in Bali or a coach tour of Thailand that people do nowadays, but just some time away, on the other side of the country, visiting relatives in Penang or staying with my aunt in Kampar and spending a few days eating chicken biscuits. All the things that a normal family would do. How much could a bus ticket have cost back then? Even now it only costs twenty ringgit, max. We could have done all that if my father had actually been sending money to us.\n\nThat was when I realised that my mother's stories were intended not to comfort me, but to reassure herself. The more she repeated them to me and Ah Heng and whoever else cared to listen, the clearer it was to me that she needed to cling to the belief that they were all true \u2013 that my father was still part of our lives, that our future was bright, and soon we'd be living on the outskirts of Klang, in one of those new housing estates that were being built \u2013 just like the one we're sitting in now.\n\nThese days, I often take a walk through the neighbourhood after dinner. Sometimes I have trouble digesting my food, I don't know why \u2013 I went to see the doctor, she took x-rays but couldn't find anything wrong. Suggested it was stress. I said, Stress, what stress? I don't have stress, what the hell do I have to worry about these days? She said, In that case no one can help you.\n\nIt's true. It's not like it's going to kill me, it just ties up my stomach sometimes, as if all the blood's been squeezed out of my insides and replaced by a lump of concrete, and sometimes I have to get down on all fours like a dog to ease the pain. I close my eyes and wait for it to pass. Sometimes it takes an hour, maybe more, and suddenly I realise I'm crying because it hurts so much, this block of rough stone inside me, and I wish my body could explode and spill everything out. I stare at the cement floor, and it soothes me. I see that there are patterns in it. From a distance it looks totally uniform, but when my face is right up close to it I notice it has uneven swirls in it. One time I saw blood on the smooth grey surface \u2013 I must have bitten my lip while trying to endure the pain in my stomach, and hadn't even realised it.\n\nPersonally, I think it's those three years of bland prison meals that are to blame. I got used to tasteless stuff, so now I can't eat greasy food any more, nothing too spicy or rich. But I just can't help it \u2013 I love fried spare ribs and _laksa_ too much. Sometimes the pain starts to ease after a few minutes, but then I'm worried it'll come back again, and that's when I go for a stroll.\n\nThe houses all look shabby nowadays. No one wants to live in these single-storey places any more, that's why. The people who live here wish they were living somewhere else. Secretly they all want to live in KL or Petaling Jaya. The drains outside the houses are blocked up by rubbish and dead leaves, the grass on the edge of the roads is overgrown and messy \u2013 the council doesn't bother to clean the streets around here. There used to be small gardens in front of the houses, now there are only cars, only Proton Sagas crammed into the concrete yards. A few doors down from me there's an old couple who use their Perodua as a kind of outdoor cupboard. At first you think it's just another small lousy old car, then you realise it's full of clothes and boxes and unwanted stuff like that. The neighbours \u2013 we see each other around and sometimes we say hi, sometimes we don't. I like it that way. No one asks me any questions.\n\nBut it wasn't supposed to be this way. When this neighbourhood was first built, I remember looking at the tiled roofs and thinking, _Whoa, they look so solid_. In some estates the houses have blue roofs, while others have green. My mother cut out an advertisement from the _Sin Chew Jit Poh_ with a drawing of a house just like this one. Far from the sea, where we wouldn't have to smell the salty stinky mud when the tide went out, full of rotting fish that had slipped from the nets of the fishing boats. A house far inland, that couldn't be swept away by freak tides or floods or storms. A place close to the city \u2013 so near that you could feel part of it, be absorbed and protected by it. She pinned the piece of newspaper to the wall in the bedroom \u2013 a patch of colour against the bare board. These places, they felt so new. It's hard to imagine that now. You drive around this kind of estate and the streets look identical, house after house after house \u2013 they're all the same, it crushes you. I know that's what people from KL think. You come from the big city and you think, _These places destroy your soul_. Even I feel like that sometimes, and I've lived here for nearly ten years. I don't know how things could have changed so much in thirty years. The houses we dreamed of then are exactly the ones we live in today, but they belong to a different world.\n\nI used to wonder how my parents felt about each other during that long period of separation \u2013 those long years of hope. Sometimes we used to watch _Shanghai Tang_ on TV, that Hong Kong series that had just come out then, which everyone was watching. We loved the costumes, the glamour \u2013 and that song! It made my mother cry every time. Once she dabbed her eyes and said, 'It must be beautiful to experience such things. To be in love like that.' And then, as if she heard the question that was forming in my head, she said, 'It's different for people like us. Your father and me, we don't have time _for all that_.'\n\nI didn't think about it when she said it, but now I do. _Didn't have time for love._ Is that what she meant? They were apart from each other, romance was impossible, I understand that. But love \u2013 that's something else, isn't it? My father was in another country earning a living far from his family, but that was another form of love. Distance is love. Separation is love. Loneliness is love.\n\nOne day \u2013 I can't remember when, but a few years after my father left for Singapore \u2013 we received a letter from him. My mother read out a couple of sentences as soon as she opened the envelope. _I have been going to church for the past few months._ _The pastor says that my life will improve because Jesus loves me._ She stood reading for a minute or so, then took the letter into the bedroom and shut the door. I can't remember exactly how the rest of the information filtered through to me in the weeks that followed \u2013 my mother never said anything as clear as\n\nYour father is not coming back.\n\nHe is living with someone else.\n\nHe has another family over there.\n\nIt was simply something I came to understand, in the way children do \u2013 that things were no longer the same. One phase of your life is over, and suddenly you're a different person, even though you don't want to be, and hadn't been planning to change. The world rearranges itself around you, and all at once you too are no longer the same. For a few bucks, my mother sold the baby clothes she'd been storing in a small box in the bedroom. She took the necklace my father had given her on their wedding day to the pawnbroker in town. She didn't take her wedding ring \u2013 that would follow a few months later. You might say, So what? We needed money, we had to sell stuff \u2013 what was new? Still, it was different. There was a finality to those small acts that maybe the logic of adults \u2013 of clever, reasoned people like you \u2013 will interpret differently, will twist and reshape to form a kinder explanation. But a child always knows the truth, and in the end I was right. He never came back.\n\n[ _Pauses. Sips tea. Rubs belly._ ]\n\nSorry. I have to stand up and take a quick walk now. Like I said, it's those three years of bland prison food that are to blame for my stomach problem.\n\n##\n\nBang bang bang. Bang bang bang. Someone is hitting the metal grille on the front door, and I know it's her.\n\nMy body aches so badly I don't think I can make it out of bed. Every time I move there's a pain in my lower back \u2013 always in the same place, ever since prison. Like a knife deep in my flesh, twisting. I try to prop myself up, but the effort makes me cry out in pain. It's as if my body is attacking itself.\n\nHey, are you there? You OK? Open up. Her voice is strong but calm.\n\nGive me a few minutes.\n\nWhat did you say?\n\nI said give me a few minutes. I realise my voice is barely more than a whisper, and I'm breathing heavily.\n\nAfter a while the pain finally subsides enough for me to get to the door. I let her in, and slump into a chair. You can't read your emails or what? I say. I told you I was ill. I cancelled the session.\n\nThat was last week's session. You said you had 'flu. You haven't answered any of your emails or texts the last few days. I even called round a couple of times.\n\nYou called round? I didn't hear.\n\nYou look terrible. You've lost a lot of weight.\n\nI shrug. I don't want to tell her that I haven't been out of the house for over ten days. I've barely got out of bed during that time.\n\nJust sit down and wait, I have something for you. She lifts up what looks like a large plastic container, and disappears into the kitchen. She comes back carrying a big bowl filled almost to the brim with soup. When she sets it down some of it spills over onto the table.\n\n_Ei_ , sorry. I'm so clumsy.\n\nThat's when I realise how hungry I am. But it's been days since I had anything to eat apart from some dry biscuits and an orange, and I don't know if I can eat so much food. Part of me feels like devouring it all in one gulp, another part of me feels like throwing up.\n\nCome, eat. She pushes the bowl gently towards me. It's my mother's special double-boiled six-flavour chicken soup. I told her to add some extra ginseng. When you have 'flu you have to eat well, otherwise your body won't be able to fight the infection. Come on, just try a bit. It's very nourishing. It'll be good for you.\n\nI stare at the bowl. Little swirls of oil make funny shapes on the surface of the soup. I take the bowl in my hands and lift it to my mouth. After one long gulp I set it back down on the table, and suddenly I find that I'm crying.\n\nLater, when I'm back in bed, I drift in and out of sleep. Sometimes I can hear her typing on her laptop. When I open my eyes it's dark, and she's standing in the doorway to the bedroom. I'm going to go now, she whispers. I can't be sure what else she says, or what time it is. The following day she arrives with more soup, some rice and some medicine. She comes for the next three days, until I'm healthy again.\n\n##\n\n_November 5th & 6th_\n\nWhen my mother announced our move, she buried it in a jumble of other information in the hope that I wouldn't worry about it until much later, when, like all children, I'd have silently processed the changes in store for us and appreciated how they would affect our lives, without her having to explain it all to me. _You're growing up fast, we'll have to buy you a new school uniform. Next year you must study harder at school. History is a useful subject, but you should concentrate on maths. It'll be easier for you at Uncle Kiat's house. He has electricity from the mains. It's quieter there. He might even give you your own room._ There was a silence at the heart of all she told me, a missing piece of the jigsaw that was both essential and superfluous \u2013 her omission made the picture baffling, but it also explained everything. What she left out was, 'We're moving out of our house, because it's falling apart. Because we can't afford to live even in a shack on the verge of collapse. Because it's killing me to raise a child and work at the same time.'\n\nI remember standing in the kitchen as she packed our possessions into raffia bags, waiting for her to elaborate on what she was saying \u2013 to give me an explanation, and maybe a hug, too, which might comfort me and give me the reassurance I needed to face this sudden shift in our circumstances. But she merely continued to talk about things that seemed unconnected to that moment \u2013 the price of fish going down that season because of an oversupply, the washing she'd have to do when she got back from work that evening, the list of chores she'd left me to do. _Collect more water from the well, ask Auntie Lian for some charcoal, make sure all your clothes are folded and ready to be packed in a bag._ I waited for reasons as to how and why the decision had been reached to move out of our home and into the house of a man we barely knew, but there were none. She talked, but the awful gaping silence remained amid her chatter. Nowadays when I remember that moment, I think: that is what shame sounds like.\n\nI had known that our lives would be changing some months before, when my mother revealed that she had divorced my father. We'd got used to him being away, and I knew, with all the certainty that only a child can have, that he was never coming back. I no longer dreamed of his return, no longer imagined lying in bed one morning and being roused from sleep by the sound of a man's voice in the kitchen and knowing that it belonged to my father, even though I'd forgotten what he sounded like, or even how he looked. That he actually lived in another country just a few hundred miles away made his absence real. He wasn't living in some Greenland, or New Zealand or Somalia, or any other fairytale land that was so distant and magical to me that it kept alive the possibility of a miraculous return. For a few months, when I was smaller, I'd imagined my father living in an igloo. What exactly he was doing in the igloo I wasn't sure, but it was connected to making sure my mother and I were all right. It had been such a difficult journey to get there that he was still trudging through thousands of miles of snow to get home. The idea of distance made him seem close to me. But by the time I was ten or eleven, I knew that there were no igloos in Singapore, and that my father lived in a place that we could get to by sitting in a bus for half a day. He wasn't coming back because he didn't want to. His proximity solidified the gulf between us.\n\nStill, when my mother sat me down and explained what a divorce meant \u2013 _it means Papa and I are still your parents but we are no longer husband and wife, do you understand?_ \u2013 I knew that it signalled a shift. I just didn't know how that shift would play out. My mother could have disguised the divorce as something gentler, or hidden it in other half-truths or incomplete stories, as she had done before and would do many times later on; but for a reason I couldn't determine, she wanted to emphasise the split with my father after all those years of waiting. 'Mama is still your Mama, but she is her own woman now,' she'd said. 'She is free.' She referred to herself as if she was talking about someone else \u2013 as if she hadn't yet got used to the idea of being the woman she described.\n\nFor a few months after the divorce announcement our lives continued without fuss or noticeable change. School for me, the fish-processing factory for my mother. After school, the dead hours at home, playing in the yard on my own, or roaming the country lanes that I'd already come to know so well. Waiting for my mother to come home. I noticed she was staying out for longer than usual, and at first I thought nothing of this development. It had always happened from time to time, when she had to do longer shifts at work, often at short notice, and as dusk fell I'd know to make myself dinner from the leftovers in the refrigerator, and not to wait for her to come home before I went to bed. But in those months her absences felt more deliberate and consistent, and sometimes, half-roused from sleep by her late return, I'd notice that the noises she made as she moved around the house were somehow different \u2013 more purposeful, even energetic, unlike the slow, heavy sounds of a normal evening when she'd worked overtime and would barely have the strength to fix herself dinner before falling into the raffia armchair and turning on the TV.\n\nThe new night-time noises confused me. The quick padding of her footsteps, criss-crossing the little house as she darted from kitchen to sitting room, back and forth. Sometimes she'd come into the bedroom, pausing to make sure she hadn't woken me before taking something from the chest of drawers. I'd pretend to be sleeping, but in fact I was kept awake by the strange energy that filled the house \u2013 an energy that should have enthused me, but that filled me with a dull dread. A fear of something that remained hazy and unnamed.\n\nIt was soon after that I learned of our move to Uncle Kiat's house on the other side of the village, and as the move drew closer I began to understand that my mother's new optimism was linked to the end of everything I found reassuring in my life. Our little house. Our evenings and Sundays together, occasionally riding on the scooter into Kuala Selangor to buy candy from the store. The feeling that we didn't need anyone else in the world to survive. My mother sighing as she dozed off in the afternoons, saying, 'I could sleep until the end of our days.' The comfort in knowing that I could sit on the bed next to her for all that time, and that when she woke up our world would still be the same. The beautiful boredom of it all, when we were together.\n\n'You'll see, Uncle Kiat's place will be much more comfortable for us,' she said as she packed the last of our things into the raffia bags. 'He's being so generous in taking us in.'\n\nI didn't figure out until later that Uncle Kiat was a distant cousin of my father's, who'd grown up with him until the age of twenty or so, when he'd left to work in Penang for a couple of years before returning home. I didn't remember him from earlier in my childhood, and his sudden entry into our lives was baffling to me \u2013 not because he was new, but because my mother talked to and about him as if he'd always been with us. 'Go fetch Uncle Kiat some tea,' she would say when he came through the door. 'You know he likes to drink tea. Hot weather, hot tea \u2013 only Uncle Kiat does that!' At first I thought I might be going mad, and that I'd forgotten the presence of this man throughout my growing-up years. I became anxious, worried that the problem was mine \u2013 why couldn't I remember him at all? But then I realised it wasn't me. The familiarity my mother showed was real \u2013 she knew this man well. Had done for a long time. She'd just never shared that familiarity with me, until now.\n\nThe journey wouldn't have taken more than twenty or thirty minutes by foot, and we didn't have many possessions to transport \u2013 three large raffia bags that between us would have been unwieldy but manageable \u2013 but Uncle Kiat came to pick us up in his green Datsun. The back doors were stuck and couldn't open, so I had to climb in over the front seat. The upholstery was torn and stuck together with black tape that chafed against the backs of my thighs as we made the short drive. My mother had been chatty all morning, but in the car she fell silent, and I wondered if she thought she'd made a mistake and was now regretting her decision. I knew, though, that she wouldn't be changing her mind \u2013 she had no choice but to follow through.\n\nUncle Kiat was silent in the car, and even that first day, without knowing the man at all, I sensed that he was by nature uncommunicative and slightly withdrawn. I wished that I didn't compare him to my father \u2013 or the version of my father who lived on in my imagination \u2013 but I couldn't help it. My cheeky, silly father, who rarely stopped talking. I closed my eyes and tried to scrub out those images. _In order to survive and be happy, I had to forget that I'd ever had a father._ I didn't know why that thought came to me just then, sitting in that hot, airless Datsun, but it did.\n\n'Uncle Kiat likes you so much, he just doesn't know how to express it.' My mother spoke softly as we unpacked our things. The sentence had the neatness and tenderness of something that had been planned in advance. 'Did you hear me?'\n\nI sat on the bed and looked around. 'Yes,' I said. The room was small but bright, and recently painted white. The floor and walls were constructed from brick and concrete and felt solid, unlike the timber boards of our old home. The mattress on the bed was soft, and I suddenly felt sleepy, even though it was only midway through the afternoon, or maybe towards the end of the day \u2013 I can't remember exactly. It was still light, in any case. I lay my head on the pillow and fell asleep at once \u2013 the deepest sleep I'd had in a long while. I heard my mother talking to me as I drifted off, but couldn't make out the words. I felt her hand sweep the hair off my forehead, the smooth warmth of her palm on my skin. Later, I heard her and Uncle Kiat talking in the next room, their voices muffled by the thick walls, reduced to low murmuring that at first surprised me \u2013 what was that sound? In our old house, noise passed through the wooden partitions as if they didn't exist \u2013 but then lulled me back to sleep. I opened my eyes briefly and blinked at the clean bare walls, but when I shut them I saw my old bedroom and believed that I was in it once again.\n\nI felt as though I was slipping into another world, where everyone looked different, wore odd clothes and spoke in a foreign accent that I found difficult to understand at first, but soon made sense of. I recognised some of them \u2013 my mother, Uncle Kiat, the people of the village \u2013 but they too were wearing strange outfits and speaking in that alien manner, in voices that were dull and mumbling. My father was there too. I didn't recognise him, but he was familiar. I knew he was my dad. All this was taking place in a city made of stone and steel, indestructible, immune to floods and winds and mudslides. The rules in this new world were altered. I slept in the day, went to school at night. Sometimes I didn't go to school at all. As I roamed through the streets of this new city I had the ability to become invisible to its citizens. Others had this gift too, but not everyone. My mother drove a car, she didn't ride her scooter any more. The car was blue, and it travelled without the need for wheels. Everything was different here.\n\nA whole lifetime later, when I was in prison, I'd remember these childhood dreams that spilled over into the following day and made my waking hours seem shorter and easier to bear. I'd try to recreate that haze-like state in my cell, try to hang on to those wisps of sleep, but it never worked. The noise of the other men shouting, washing, eating \u2013 it ruined everything.\n\nFor several months after we moved, my mother continued to work at the factory. 'Not for long,' she told me, 'Uncle Kiat is going to find me better work down in Klang. He's got friends in town, people who run businesses. I could even work in an office!' It was clear from the start that whatever Uncle Kiat did for a living was unconnected to the life of the village, just as the house itself felt different from the others around it. Even though it wasn't a new house, its efficiency made it feel fresh \u2013 doors and windows that worked, framed by metal that wasn't rusting. Inside, white-painted walls, a ceiling fan that spun without wobbling or stuttering. The cleanliness of it all made it seem almost suburban, as if it didn't belong in the village.\n\nUncle Kiat would still be in the house when I left for school, wearing only his red Liverpool FC shorts that he never changed. Sometimes he'd still be in bed when I left, other times he'd have just woken up \u2013 he seemed in no rush to get to work. When he did finally leave he'd drive to Klang, where he was a supervisor in a factory near the port that made rubber gloves. 'From Telok Gong to the rest of the world,' he once boasted. 'Germany, USA, Korea. Go to a hospital anywhere in the world, you'll find our gloves. Even China can't compete with us.' There were boxes of them throughout the house, half a finger of a glove sticking out and inviting you to pull it out like a sheet of tissue paper. Uncle Kiat wore them all the time to clean the house. He was always cleaning, wiping the edges of the window sills or climbing onto a chair to brush the dust off the blades of the fan. I'd never seen anyone else in the village tidy their house with such determination and precision. No one else had as much time or energy to devote to domestic chores as he did. If you come home after a night at sea or doing the late shift at the factory, the last thing you want to do is tidy the house.\n\nWhat I couldn't figure out was his work routine \u2013 why the world's mightiest manufacturer of rubber gloves didn't demand his presence on a regular basis. I'd grown up with people who worked in factories. I knew the rhythms of their days and nights, the way their shifts changed according to the seasons and public holidays. But Uncle Kiat's days were regular only in their irregularity \u2013 the only thing I knew for sure each day was that I could never tell what time he'd be leaving for work, or if he'd be leaving at all.\n\nDeciphering his routine was important, because I needed to reduce my time with him to a minimum, if not eliminate it altogether. Sometimes I'd arrive back from school and he'd be sitting in front of the TV, shirtless and still in the same shorts he'd been wearing that morning and in fact the night before. He'd look up briefly without acknowledging me and turn the volume up even louder on the TV, so that the gunshots and explosions of the cops-and-gangsters shows he liked would vibrate through the walls. Even when I shut the door I'd hear the screeching of brakes, the crunch of metal on metal as if there were real-life car chases going on just outside, threatening to smash their way into my room at any moment. I'd put my head under the pillow, but would still hear the noise. _Leave me alone!_ I screamed one day. _Leave me the fuck alone!_ I wanted to flee, but I was trapped in the room by the noise, which formed a barrier that made it impossible for me to leave.\n\nI was staying out later and later, heading home only when it got dark and I could be reasonably sure that my mother would be there too. At first she'd be worried that I'd stayed out so late, and would give me extra portions at dinner. 'Where have you been? What have you been doing?' she'd ask. 'Nothing,' I'd reply. 'Just roaming around.' Which was entirely true. That was what I did, sometimes with other kids but often on my own. But soon, when she realised I was fine, that I wasn't getting in trouble, she was relieved to have a bit of time without me. I'd come home to find her and Uncle Kiat already in front of the TV, dinner cleared away and the table wiped clean with the disinfectant Uncle Kiat favoured. The smell of it was always in the air, the special perfume of the house. Other homes had the odour of joss-sticks, or of food. In that house it was bleach. My food would be on a plate under a net cover in the kitchen, and I'd eat it alone, standing at the sink and looking out of the window at the back of the boatsheds. 'Don't forget to tidy up when you've finished,' my mother would shout over the noise of the TV.\n\nIn those first months my mother would sleep in the same bed with me as she'd always done. 'See? Nothing's changed,' she'd whisper as I fell asleep. In the night, when I stirred, I'd look across and see her sleeping on her side, facing me, her mouth pursed slightly as she exhaled \u2013 a sight I'd known since the beginning of time. But despite her assurances I knew that things were different \u2013 how could they not be? \u2013 and so one night when, thinking I was asleep, she got up and left the room I wasn't surprised. It was confirmation of how our life was beginning to reshape itself \u2013 the mattress giving way slightly as she rose from the bed, the door clicking shut as she closed it behind her, the warmth of her presence when she returned later in the night. Was she gone for one hour, or two, or eight? I never knew for certain, but at some point, when it was still dark, she would return, and by the time I woke up properly in the morning she was always there, just as she had been when I'd fallen asleep the night before.\n\nAfter about three months, my mother quit her job at the factory \u2013 or maybe she was fired, I'm not sure. 'Can't stand that place any more,' she told me. 'When you're big, you're not going to work in a place like that.' She got a job in an office down in the port area, much further away from the village than she'd ever worked, but the distance from home seemed to free her. Each day she'd set off on her scooter as if she were travelling abroad for the very first time \u2013 briskly, but a little hesitant too, as if unsure of what lay in wait for her. But that sense of discovery soon gave way to the same fatigue she'd known \u2013 we'd both known \u2013 in her years working at the fish factory, replaced by the boredom of routine. It was some time before I found out that she was a janitor, not a book-keeper or sales manager or any of the other things she could have been, and thought she might have been. I saw her name badge once, attached to the end of a ribbon that she would have hung around her neck. Her photo made her look older than she was \u2013 all the promise squeezed out of her life, an idea that started to gather on the edges of my own brain, like the shards of frost in the freezer that grew thicker every month until they formed a dense crust. The idea that my mother's life had run out of possibilities. Her life frozen. When she was not even forty years old. Under her name were the words _Hygiene and Sanitary_.\n\nNow, when I think about it, what strikes me isn't the idea of my mother emptying waste bins in an office block under the white glow of fluorescent lights. I think of the impossibility of that happening now, when every janitor in the country is a foreigner. People like my mother \u2013 what would they do for work? Maybe by a process of natural promotion she would have become the book-keeper she'd always dreamed of being. One layer forms underneath you and pushes you up towards the surface, just like the geographical formations I was learning about at school. But maybe not, maybe she would have just ended up exactly as she did.\n\nIt was around that time that I began to notice that my mother had virtually stopped spending time with other people in the village, and that, by extension, I rarely went to other people's houses. I don't mean that it was a particularly social kind of village \u2013 not the way you would understand it, at least. You didn't invite people round for fancy meals, but you'd often drop in on neighbours when you needed something \u2013 a length of string, a screwdriver, some salt, whatever. You'd meet them in the street and they'd say, 'I've just boiled some barley-tofu drink, come and have some,' and you'd spend the next half-hour catching up on news. My mother had been especially social in that respect. When I was very small, riding on the scooter with her, I'd become aware of how ready she was with her greetings, how open she was to other people, even those she barely knew, like a new bus driver or a neighbour's relative visiting from another part of the country. She was always slowing down to wave to someone, and if anyone called out to her she'd stop altogether. My first memories of the village are of observing it from the scooter, sitting in front of my mother, cradled in her lap and reaching out for the handlebars as if I was steering it myself. The number of times I heard people say, 'He's growing up so quickly,' or 'Watch out \u2013 soon he'll be stealing that bike and riding down to KL with it!' I noticed the warmth in their voices, even when they were breathless and defeated by a night at sea, or a day at the factory, or working with the nets under the sun.\n\nAt that age \u2013 four, five, six \u2013 you don't understand every word, and you don't remember what you hear, but you sense the impression of the voices. Brightness. Jealousy. Affection. Danger. And when people spoke to my mother it was almost always with a sort of tenderness mixed with surprise, as if they were intimately tied to her, and their meeting on the street was a special occasion, even though they saw each other all the time. Looking back on it now, maybe what I heard as warmth was in fact pity. Or relief. _Young woman like her, bringing up a small child all on her own, husband probably gone for good. Poor miserable thing. Thank God we're not in that position._ Whatever the reason, I knew one thing: people liked my mother.\n\nNow that I was older \u2013 pushing eleven, I guess \u2013 I rode on the scooter with her less often, so it took me a while to sense the loosening of her contact with our village, or the changing nature of her relationship with people she'd always been close to. I put it down to her job, more time-consuming those days even than before. She had little time to spend with me, let alone others. She was tired. She was getting old. But most of all, she was spending whatever free time she had with Uncle Kiat. Often they would just sit in front of the TV the whole evening, but sometimes they'd go out \u2013 I never knew where. At first there was a display of concern. 'Tonight, Mama and Uncle Kiat have to go out, OK? You promise you won't be frightened? You won't be scared to stay at home alone?'\n\n'It's OK,' Uncle Kiat would say in an exaggeratedly manly voice. 'He's a big boy, he'll be fine. Won't you?' He'd pat me on the back, a bit too roughly, more like a blow than a gesture of affection, and I'd say, 'Sure. Don't worry.'\n\nSoon I recognised this as an elaborate performance, more for themselves than for me. They knew I'd be all right. Back then kids were different. At ten, eleven, twelve, we knew how to look after ourselves. But very swiftly, even this pretence stopped, and when I came home late in the afternoon, when the sun was just beginning to lose its vigour, the house would be empty, and I knew it was one of those days when my mother had finished work early and planned an outing with Uncle Kiat. Their absence felt deliberate. Like a statement of something they couldn't bring themselves to pronounce in words. Or maybe they couldn't even articulate what it was. But I knew: they preferred it when I was out of the picture. It was easier for them when they didn't see me, or have to explain the changing ways of adult life to me. I wasn't so much a burden \u2013 how could I have been? I was hardly around those days, my life was breaking off from theirs, even from my mother's \u2013 as a reminder of their guilt. I didn't know what they'd done to feel guilty. All I could feel was that they _were_ guilty. Of something. And every time they looked at me, they felt it too.\n\nThe first Chinese New Year after we moved in with Uncle Kiat, my mother went with him to visit some of his relatives who lived on the east coast, not far from Kuantan. They were fishermen too, my mother told me, people just like us. Nice people. How do you know? I thought. You've never met them. They were away for three days, and during that time they left me to stay with neighbours. They were good to me, they gave me tangerines from Taiwan and an _ang bao_ of five ringgit. On the second day, a visitor \u2013 someone from the village who I'd known forever \u2013 asked about my mother.\n\n'How is she? We never see her these days. She's spending New Year with Kiat?'\n\nI nodded. 'In Kuantan.'\n\n'She OK?'\n\n'Mmm.'\n\n'Happy in the new house?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\nShe picked up a newspaper and started to flick through it. The other kids were unfurling some firecrackers out in the yard. Someone shouted, _Go out in the street! Get away from the house!_ 'Huh,' the neighbour said as she looked at the newspaper. 'I always knew.'\n\nI left the room and ran to join the other kids out on the street. One of them had tied the string of firecrackers to a tree trunk and was dragging it across the dirt. It looked like a sinewy red animal tethered to the tree, limp and about to die. I pushed my way through the crowd gathered around the fuse and seized the cigarette lighter from the boy who was holding it. In one swift motion I flicked it alight and held it to the fuse. The other kids dispersed like smoke carried on the wind, screaming with joy and terror. _He's nuts, that guy!_ I held the lighter steady and waited for the fuse to catch. Even when it started to fizz and sizzle I remained crouched by it, making sure the purple flame of the lighter didn't blow out. _Get out of there you're crazy you're gonna die!_ the other kids were shouting. I watched the tiny sparks run the length of the fuse. Don't run, hold steady, I thought to myself. I imagined the firecrackers exploding in my face, the hot smoke singeing my skin, ripping it. _Don't run_. At the very last moment I leaped away. The brilliant eruption of colours, so close, too close, blinded me for a few moments, but I didn't shut my eyes. The other kids were laughing, cheering, screaming wildly. 'Ah Hock is mad!'\n\nWe stood watching the remains of the firecrackers strewn across the street \u2013 charred bits of paper, black and blood-red, like pieces of skin. The smell of gunpowder hung in the air for a long time.\n\n_I always knew_.\n\nI couldn't get the neighbour's words out of my head.\n\nWhen she and Uncle Kiat came back from Kuantan my mother rushed up to me and gathered me in her arms. She held me tightly and didn't let me go for a long time. I wanted to surrender to the familiarity of her, the deep comfort of her embrace, I wanted to cry with relief and happiness; but instead I found that my body was rigid and unresponsive as she hugged me. I wanted her to go away again, leave for some place far from me.\n\n'Leave him be,' Uncle Kiat said as he unloaded the car, carrying a basket of fruit into the house. 'He's happier on his own.'\n\nIn the weeks that followed, my mother made a special effort to spend time with me, with and without Uncle Kiat. We rode all the way to Tanjung Harapan on her scooter, just the two of us, and sat on the low stone ramparts eating a small picnic of slices of fried Spam and bread. We watched the tankers and container ships cruise slowly towards North Port, the colourful containers stacked on top of each other like pieces of Lego. Beyond the green-grey water, the line of low mangrove trees on Pulau Klang looked as soft as a thick green rug. It was late afternoon, the sun was just beginning to sink, and young couples began to appear, holding hands and strolling along the path that traced the water's edge. Groups of young men horsed around on the huge rocks that protected the shoreline from tides and wayward ships; they leaped from one boulder to another, pausing sometimes to pick up empty whisky bottles which they'd fling out to sea. A group of Indonesian workers on their day off had made a little fire in a metal drum nearby, and were cooking pieces of food over it \u2013 I couldn't tell what it was because the smoke was too thick, a column rising straight into the sky. There was no breeze at all that day, but it wasn't hot.\n\nMy mother stared out at the sea for a long time without saying much. I reached out and touched her hand, and though she clasped mine tightly, she didn't look at me. For a few moments I felt as though she was about to tell me something, but she remained silent. The sun had sunk almost to the crests of the mangrove trees when we gathered our things to leave. I sensed a sort of finality \u2013 the end of yet another period of my life, but not yet the beginning of the next.\n\nOnce, we went with Uncle Kiat to the movies in Klang. It was my first proper outing in the city, or at least the first I can remember. He bought us a box of Famous Amos cookies that my mother rationed carefully, passing me one at a time and waiting for me to express my gratitude sufficiently before handing me the next. 'Say \"thank you\" to Uncle Kiat,' she'd prod if I didn't do so, and I dutifully obliged. I must have thanked him fifty times that day. The film was _Honey, I Shrunk the Kids_ , and Uncle Kiat laughed loudly throughout, throwing his head back to release a full-throated roar. 'Shh,' my mother said, giggling and pretending to smack him on the shoulder. I couldn't understand why he found the movie so funny. The story of ordinary kids who suddenly found themselves reduced to the size of insects terrified me, and I spent most of the film with my hands in front of my eyes, screening out the worst of the horror. One moment you have a normal family life, next moment you're being chased by a giant scorpion and taking refuge in a worm hole. No one notices you. You're so tiny your own dad sweeps you up like a piece of dust and dumps you in the trash like the piece of garbage that you've become. 'Look at them!' Uncle Kiat pointed at the screen as the kids tumbled into the huge metal container. I didn't find any of the film funny, and I hated Uncle Kiat for laughing so much. The man in the seat in front of me was asleep, his snoring clearly audible. ' _Wei_ , old man, wake up!' Uncle Kiat barked at him, and laughed. ' _Aiya_ , leave him alone,' my mother said, but she was giggling too. She held Uncle Kiat's hand, and they leaned in towards each other as if they were about to kiss, but didn't.\n\nTo avoid looking at the screen, or at my mother and Uncle Kiat, I watched the man, fast asleep with his head tilted to one side and his mouth hanging open. He wasn't so old, about the same age as Uncle Kiat. He looked peaceful, completely docile, and I wished that he was the one sitting next to my mother instead of Uncle Kiat.\n\nOn the drive home, my mother turned to look at me in the back seat. 'Wasn't that the best day of your life?' she asked.\n\nI nodded.\n\nShe turned towards Uncle Kiat. 'He's really so happy,' she said.\n\nI began to understand the widening gulf between her and the people of the village, and knew that it was to do with her decision to move in with Uncle Kiat. I felt a separation between us and our neighbours, as if the earth was opening up and dividing the landscape in two. On one side was my mother and Uncle Kiat, on the other, everyone else. I was her child, I should have been happy standing on her side, but all I wanted was to leap across the chasm and be with everyone else.\n\nIn the end I started to drift away from the rest of the village too. I was fearful of hearing things about my mother that would hurt me. I stopped hanging out with the other kids, especially the older ones, who would have more knowledge of the ways of adults, and less fear of expressing what they knew. I roamed the paths and tracks that cut through the countryside, going further and further afield. I'd always done that, but in that period of my growing-up years I can't remember anything else. The further I walked, the more the landscape seemed to close in on me, suffocating me. I wondered how old I'd have to be before I could leave home and work in another city, or preferably another continent. Seventeen, eighteen? An eternity away.\n\nI didn't realise it then, but there was to be no return to the fold, not even when the original cause of our separation from the other people in the village had been scrubbed from our record. About a year after this, when we'd been living at Uncle Kiat's for about two years, I came home and found my mother sitting on the edge of the bed. This was a surprise. I'd grown used to arriving home at dusk to find an empty house. Grown used to the comforting bitterness of knowing that my mother was out with Uncle Kiat. I'd become accustomed, above all, to having the room to myself, as my mother had given up all pretences and was spending her nights in Uncle Kiat's room. 'It'll be nicer for you,' she'd said, 'now that you're growing up.' She was reading a newspaper when I entered the room that day. When she saw me she put it down and folded it neatly. I stared at her, expecting a scolding. _You're late. You're lazy. You haven't cleaned the house_. Such admonishments were common, and I never knew when they'd be thrown my way. Instead she said in a flat tone of voice, 'We're moving out. Very soon.'\n\nThe clarity of the statement was confusing to me. This time it wasn't obscured by a mass of other information \u2013 there was nothing for me to decipher, no codes or signals for me to piece together. Maybe it was because I was older that my mother trusted me with this directness, but from that moment I knew that she had changed yet again, and that this new certainty and decisiveness would stay with her forever. 'It'll be much better for us,' she said as I stood blinking, unable fully to digest what she was saying. 'You wait and see.' That night she slept in the bedroom with me, and though I wish I could say it was a relief, and that I was happy, the truth is that I found it impossible to sleep. Her sudden presence after many months unsettled me. Her breathing, turning to a soft rumbling noise now and then. The way she sighed deeply in her sleep \u2013 as if a word had become stuck in her throat and emerged only as a twisted groan.\n\nThe day we left, Uncle Kiat hung around the house, pretending to wipe the floors with a bleach-soaked rag, but I could see that he was watching us pack our things. Every time he walked past the open door of our room he'd look in, and sometimes he'd cough, as if to make sure we knew he was there. But my mother ignored him, didn't once acknowledge his presence. She was checking the empty drawers one last time when Uncle Kiat appeared at the door. 'You don't have to go today, you know,' he said quietly. 'You can wait until your new place is ready to move into.'\n\n'Don't worry,' my mother replied without looking at him. 'The sooner we leave, the happier your family will be.'\n\nUncle Kiat looked at the floor. He unfolded the rag he was clutching and rubbed his fingers on it. He continued to stare at a spot on the floor as if he wanted to scrub it away.\n\nMy mother zipped up the last of our bags and started to carry them towards the door. As I helped her I noticed that we had less than we'd arrived with.\n\n'You sure you don't want me to drive you there?' Uncle Kiat said. 'It's a long way.'\n\n'Don't trouble yourself,' my mother replied. 'Save your petrol to go visit your parents in Kuantan. Anyway, my son will help me. I'm an _unmarried woman who already has a child_ \u2013 remember?'\n\nI never saw Uncle Kiat after that day. I had no reason to go near his house, and not long afterwards I heard that he'd moved to the east coast to join his cousins there. Once he was gone, people in the village would occasionally refer to him as _that_ _good-for-nothing man_. When I was a bit older I learned that he'd had an injury of some kind and been laid off work from the glove factory. He'd managed to arrange a compensation payment, which made him think he was rich, and better than everyone else. All those days when I thought he was at work, it turns out he was just driving into Klang and hanging around in coffee shops, watching the world go by.\n\nMy mother never mentioned him, or the time we spent living with him. There was no need to \u2013 we both understood what had happened, and neither of us wanted to discuss that time of our lives. Besides, we had new challenges on our hands now, which kept us occupied day and night.\n\n##\n\nLet's go out, she says. Buy some food. I don't think you're eating properly, that's why you get sick.\n\nFood? What food? I'm the healthiest person in the world.\n\nYou need to eat more healthily. Fresh fruit and vegetables. Nuts, grains. Decent protein.\n\nCurry laksa doesn't have protein, meh?\n\nActually, no. Not much. It has plenty of fat, though. Let's go to the mall, get some groceries, and then I'll drive you back. We won't get anything expensive, just decent basics. When you were ill a couple of weeks back I looked through your cupboards and there was nothing.\n\nWe've finished early today. Our talk didn't last as long as it sometimes does. Maybe I had nothing special to say. Sure, I say. Why not.\n\nIn the mall we head to Giant supermarket, and she pulls a trolley from the row of them at the entrance.\n\nWhy do we need such a huge trolley? I say. Just a small basket is enough. I don't need much food.\n\nLet's just see how it goes.\n\nWe go straight to the fresh produce section and she begins to put things into the trolley, so quickly it seems she hasn't even looked properly at what she's taken. She chooses things I would never think of buying \u2013 freshly-sliced fruit, neatly wrapped in plastic boxes. Fuji apples from Taiwan. Big bunches of leafy vegetables. Shiitake mushrooms.\n\n_Wai_ , this stuff is too expensive.\n\nIt's good for your skin, she says, holding up a big purple dragon fruit.\n\nI can't afford it, I don't have money.\n\nDon't worry about that. She turns away from me and continues putting things in the trolley. I try to keep up with her but she moves quickly. She's mapped everything out in her head. It's like the way she questions me during our talks. She has mental lists and she works through them without being distracted. Packets of dried herbs for soup. A whole fresh fish. A chicken. Pork ribs.\n\nWhy so much? It'll all go rotten.\n\nWe'll freeze the meat so you can use it whenever you want. How about some New Zealand beef? You like beef?\n\nI don't eat beef.\n\nI don't either. In fact I'm vegetarian. But I think you should eat meat. You need it right now. Shame there isn't good organic meat. All this is just pretty... industrial. Anyway. You need to eat.\n\nBy the time we reach the checkout, the trolley is so full that it keeps banging against the shelves and other people's legs. It takes us a long time to load everything onto the conveyor.\n\nYou pack, I'll pay, she says.\n\nAfter a long while, when the bags are nearly full and she is getting ready to pay, I hear her scream. Oh my God. She is staring at a shelf not far from us, at a row of tinned food. _Oh my God_.\n\nThe Burmese guy at the checkout turns to look. The other people in the queue behind us do so too. One young man looks concerned. We can't see what she's staring at.\n\nWhat's the matter? I ask.\n\nThere. Oh my God. Fuck.\n\nA rat darts out from under the shelves, across the aisle to the shelves opposite. After a few seconds it scurries back again. Oh my God, that's disgusting. Someone call management!\n\nThe checkout guy starts to laugh. The people in the queue chuckle too. Everyone relaxes. They continue to pack their groceries or check their phones.\n\nWhat the hell are you people laughing at? Can't you see there's vermin over there? We need to do something about it!\n\nIt's just a rat, I say, packing the last of the bags. It's no big deal.\n\nWhat do you mean, just a rat? You're going to just let it run around like that? Call your manager, she says to the checkout guy, lodge a report right now.\n\nMiss. Hey, miss, someone calls from the queue. It's an older man. Could you please hurry? My legs are aching.\n\nYeah, someone else says. We have to go back to work.\n\nYou're all just going to stand there and do nothing? she says. Where's the manager? I'm going to report it! Otherwise the whole place is soon going to be infested and diseased!\n\nI gather the bags into the trolley and begin pushing it to the car park. Forget it, I say. It's just a small thing.\n\nWhat the hell are you smiling at? she says. It's not funny.\n\nNothing, I say. She keeps talking about the rat all the way home, and even after we've put all the shopping away, she's still grumbling about how no one did anything. That's the problem with this country, we let stuff happen that shouldn't happen, we turn a blind eye to little things, then the rot sets in. No one cares about anything any more.\n\nI look at the fridge. I've never seen it so full. I want to thank her for all the things she's bought for me, but she's in a bad mood until she leaves, and I can't find the right time to tell her that I'm really grateful.\n\n##\n\n_November 7th_\n\nWe bought the piece of land with the last of my mother's savings, a small amount of money I didn't even know she had. Doing the kind of jobs she'd done, you wouldn't have expected her to have put any money aside, but she had. Just enough to buy an acre and a half of scrubland, with a small house already on it, run-down and full of roosting bats, but with a roof that didn't have too many holes, and surprisingly solid walls built from cinder blocks on a concrete floor. I could remember the man who used to live in it, Pak Awang, who collapsed one day from a heart attack, and when he came home had to hobble around the place with the aid of a walking stick. _Poor old man_ , people said. _All on his own in a place like that._ When he finally got too weak to walk, his children moved him up to Shah Alam, close to where they lived. In only five years, his land \u2013 a small vegetable plot and two fish ponds \u2013 had turned wild, reclaimed by nature so you couldn't tell it had recently been home to a human being. Long grass obscured the shape of the land, the prickly shrubs he'd planted as boundaries had meshed together, and small trees had taken root, blending into the forest beyond. The ponds were shrouded by weeds and looked like puddles of marshy water. We couldn't even get near them that first day.\n\nI remembered what the people in the village had said about Pak Awang \u2013 why would anyone want to live so far from everyone else? Now I knew. For my mother and me, isolation was our saviour.\n\n'The land is messy because that guy was old,' my mother said as we set about cleaning the house. 'Besides, he was alone.' She was attacking the rough, bare concrete walls with a wire brush while I mopped the floor. She stopped for a moment and looked at me. 'There are two of us. It'll be easy.'\n\nShe was determined to turn that patch of land into a small fertile farm, with vegetables and maybe some tilapia that we could sell at the market. It would all be ours, we wouldn't need to depend on anyone else. No one could sack her, no one could evict us. We were secure now. We were the masters \u2013 of our own piece of earth, of our futures. And so we set about clearing the land even before the house was patched up; the rich red earth was going to provide us with our income. We had two spades, a small axe and a rusty _parang_ , whose curved blade bore traces of red paint, as dark as blood. That was the tool my mother used more than any other, hacking away at the undergrowth with long, powerful strokes. From twenty or thirty yards away I'd look up and see a sapling shaking as though caught in a gust of wind, and I'd know that my mother was chopping at its base, and soon it would topple and fall. She worked with a concentration so intense that it blocked out the rest of the world, and sometimes when I called out to her she wouldn't hear me, wouldn't stop until she had managed to slash all the branches from a bush. Often I'd stand and watch for a few moments. The rhythmic arc of her arm. The strength of her back as it curved to bring the blade down onto the foliage, time and time again. She moved methodically, as if she knew the effect of every cut of the _parang_ \u2013 as if she was trying to match her strength to that of nature, and she knew she could win. I don't know what my father did for work, or even what he looked like, but I know that I inherited my capacity for physical labour from my mother. I was not yet thirteen, and my body was ready to imitate my mother's. I copied her movements, learned to use the axe with speed and certainty, until after just a couple of days I no longer had to think about what I was doing. The tools became part of me.\n\nAt the end of the third day we stood on a mound of branches that we'd chopped down, balancing carefully on the springy pile. The land looked barely different from how it had when we started. The sea was just a few hundred yards away, shimmering in the late-afternoon sun, flat and waveless that day. The impossibility of our task lay before us. We'd worked without pause for nearly three days, and we hadn't made any difference to the landscape. My mother went back to the house without saying a word, leaving me to contemplate the days ahead. We had no choice but to continue.\n\nIt took us three or four weeks to clear the land. I became so used to working with blades of all sorts that when I closed my eyes all I could see was the slashing and ripping of foliage, the splintering of wood. In that short time I had learned to wield those tools as skilfully as a martial-arts disciple trained in the Eighteen Forms of Combat. It wasn't just my arms that had grown accustomed to this new awareness \u2013 I could use either hand to chop at a stump of wood, even though I wrote with my right hand \u2013 but my back, arcing and twisting to support my shoulders, and my legs, planted firmly on the ground. I could feel my body filling out, growing stronger and surer. I moved with the assurance of someone older, swifter. Sometimes, cutting away at the base of a tree with the same repetitive action, I'd imagine that I was a hero from the _wuxia_ stories I'd started to read, wandering the countryside redressing the wrongs of an oppressed people. Old villagers bullied by unscrupulous landlords, isolated farming communities preyed upon by bandits \u2013 I would save them all, my elegant weapons cutting through the air with noble authority. Sword, staff, spear and broadsword: I had achieved total mastery of all of them from years of practice, and I could even slay the demons that roamed the country, terrorising all those who tried to confront them.\n\nIn one of my favourite reveries, I pictured our own village being menaced for years by a monster that rose from the sea in the form of a white half-dragon-half-cat. No one understood its history or origins, or where it lived and why it chose to ravage our village. We only knew that it had always been there, from the earliest days of our existence, and even before. Some said it represented our sins from former lives, others that it was part of our karma \u2013 either way, there was nothing we could do about it. We didn't know how to predict its appearances, though some thought they were linked to the cycles of the moon. It would snake its way silently out of the sea and devour the livestock \u2013 the goats tethered in the yards and the chickens in the coops would disappear at night, and sometimes small children too. Old folk and people with illnesses would be found dead in their beds in the morning \u2013 from fright, from the curse of the beast. The Night of the Monster. We'd realise it only when it was too late. The strong, healthy men and women knew it was futile trying to combat the beast \u2013 it was an understanding passed down from generation to generation. Lock your doors, mind your own business, and maybe you'll remain unscathed, your family frightened but alive.\n\nPeople had tried to fight the monster in the past, and each time they had been crushed, their bodies mutilated and left behind as proof of the creature's power. This continued until I was born. I, humble little Ah Hock, who no one noticed, was devoting my childhood to training my mind and body, every day under the blinding sun. Not even the monster itself would know I existed. But I did. And that was its mistake, underestimating someone like me. Because I was there, improving myself with every cut of the blade, and one night there I was, standing at the end of the lane that led down to the inlet from which the awful creature rose. _Die, evil demon! I am the vision of your hell!_ The thick tangle of vines and branches warped into the flesh of the monster for me. I hacked and beat at it with all my might, feeling my razor-sharp blades sink into the denseness of it. I didn't stop until I had vanquished the beast. Mortally wounded but not quite dead, it slithered back into the sea, fearful now of the people it had terrorised for so many years.\n\nThe following morning the people of the village would see the trail of monster blood in the fields, and know they were at last free. They would not know the identity of their _wuxia_ hero, but some would whisper as they gathered at home to celebrate, _It was Ah Hock who saved us all._\n\nThose elaborate fantasies kept me occupied during the long hours working on the land. I slipped into such daydreams as easily as my mother tumbled into a deep sleep at night. I'd stay awake for a while after she fell asleep. I wanted to be sure she was resting before I surrendered to sleep myself. It didn't matter much to me if I slept or not. Tomorrow, I thought, in the full light of day, I'll have the chance to dream again.\n\nSpeaking of dreaming: during the trial, when my thoughts began to drift away in the heat and endless talking in the courtroom, I'd think back to those long days on the farm, my whole body training itself to cut and slash at everything that stood in my way. Maybe it wasn't surprising that my arms and legs reacted the way they did all those years later, on the riverbank facing that as-yet nameless man. When my defence lawyer insisted that I had no control over my actions, and that they had been _totally without precedent_ , I suddenly remembered the sharpness of the blades of my childhood \u2013 their lightness in my hands.\n\nAs I began to see the boundaries of our piece of land \u2013 began to see bare earth and water now that the thorny scrub had been cut back \u2013 I started to feel a sense of permanence that I'd never experienced before. A feeling that I was connected to an unchanging place that belonged to me. A place that owned _me_. The sea was always restless, constantly twisting and warping, flowing away from us or overwhelming us. We were never certain of anything with the sea, but the soil \u2013 our soil \u2013 was solid. It would not leave, not even after we had left it.\n\nWhen we were digging the first of the vegetable beds, my mother would often stop and stare at our plot of land. She'd shield her eyes from the glare of the sun and stand motionless.\n\n'What's the matter?' I'd ask.\n\n'Just looking,' she'd reply. 'Checking.'\n\n'What do you think is going to happen \u2013 the land is going to disappear like smoke?' I joked. 'Even if you set fire to it, the land will still be the same.' It was true. When we burnt one part of the land to clear space to plant vegetables, the flames had danced over the surface of the earth, but after the fire had died out the soil remained exactly as it had been before. Rich red-brown in colour.\n\nShe laughed as she resumed tilling the soil. We were working the earth with _cangkuls_ at that point \u2013 the one I was using was the same size as the ones adults use, and each time I lifted it and brought it crashing down into the thick red mud I knew that I was now able to do as much work as my mother. I hadn't fully realised up to that point how much of a burden I'd been to her. Perhaps I'd sensed it in the way that children do, but once that awareness had fully entered my thinking, I had to prove to her that I could make her life easier, not harder.\n\nWe planted the first of the vegetables just at the end of the rainy season, when the heaviest downfalls were over and the earth was heavy with moisture. We chose leafy vegetables we knew would grow quickly, as well as sweet potato, which in just a few months began to grow like a weed. Towards the end of the season we harvested some things for ourselves \u2013 for the first time in our lives we enjoyed a feeling of abundance, of having a supply of food that wasn't dependent on someone else. Nature, from which we'd always protected ourselves, was now providing us with a means to survive and be independent.\n\nThe rains were just right that first year \u2013 constant but never too heavy, and all our crops grew well. My mother was able to take a stall in the market in Kuala Selangor and sell whatever we grew. We dug a second vegetable plot, and a third, and soon my mother had a bigger stall, and regular customers who especially liked our string beans and _choy sum_. The first time I helped out at the stall, on a Saturday morning, I heard people greeting my mother by name. _Boss Lee_ they called her, as they exchanged their news. 'That's your son that you've been talking about!' they said when they saw me. 'What a strong healthy boy \u2013 you're lucky!'\n\n'Must be joking,' my mother laughed, and ruffled my hair. 'Look at this good-for-nothing lazy worm.'\n\nHer customers dressed differently from the people of the village \u2013 not exactly like big-city dwellers, but not country folk either, with proper shirts and trousers, that didn't look as if they came from a night market. They spoke to my mother politely, even when they haggled over the price. They seemed to know about me \u2013 the fact that school was becoming a problem because I wasn't very good at maths or science \u2013 and sometimes my mother talked to them about me as if I wasn't there at all. _What can I do, he's lost interest in school. His teacher says he doesn't pay attention, he's tired all the time. Boys must be good at maths, otherwise die wor._ I hated being invisible, but I was comforted to see the customers' familiarity with my mother. She had a life outside the farm, a life that included other people than me, who knew about the problems she faced, and even if only for a few minutes a day, she could feel as though they took an interest in her.\n\nIt was about that time that her hearing began to fail. I'd always known that she had a slight problem, because she spoke louder than she needed to. I don't mean that she shouted, it was just that her voice was pitched as though she was constantly making an announcement. It was the result of an infection in her inner ear that she'd suffered as a child, she'd always explained. 'Too much playing in the rain.' I never believed she'd ever had a proper medical assessment of her condition. How could she have? Families like hers wouldn't have had the means to send her to a doctor for something as minor as that. During that period, when the small farm was expanding and we often found ourselves working the soil fifty or sixty yards apart from each other, I'd call out to her and she wouldn't look up, but continued carefully pressing the earth around the base of the seedlings she was planting row by row. I thought it might have been the intense concentration on her task that distracted her; I thought she was in her own bubble, savouring the knowledge that those little sprigs of green \u2013 barely even recognisable as leaves \u2013 would soon be sold for money. _Ma!_ It was only when I emptied my lungs in a full-throated cry that she'd look up in surprise and wave at me. Otherwise she'd continue working the soil, squatting so she could get close to the ground. Her back had started to ache from all the work we were doing, so it was easier that way. 'Look, my hips are still flexible,' she'd say. 'I'm still a young woman!'\n\nI knew for certain that the problem was getting worse the week we released the fish into the ponds. We'd cleared the edges of the two murky pools of water to reveal a pair of neat squares. Old Pak Awang must have used a bulldozer to dig them all those years ago \u2013 there was no way nature was capable of such perfection. Once the edges of the ponds were defined, I slid into the water to clear away the weeds that had entirely covered their surfaces with a thin carpet. I trod water carefully \u2013 growing up in a fishing village teaches you never to trust what lies under the surface \u2013 and I was afraid of cutting my feet on sharp pieces of wood, or sheets of metal or other junk that had been thrown into the ponds' surprising depths. Unlike the sea, their water was stagnant and slightly cold, and I wondered what lay at the bottom, whether if I dived down to the muddy bed I'd find old bones \u2013 the skeletons of fish or monkeys, or even humans. I scooped the weed out of the ponds and dumped it on the grassy banks, where it collected in small piles.\n\nI'd been in the water for some time on the second day when I felt my leg twitch \u2013 a sudden sharp contraction. A monster, I thought. A real goddamn monster. I writhed in panic as I felt my leg tighten from the toes all the way to the calf. I didn't know what was happening, and I began to thrash about, but I was in the middle of the pond, and the safety of the banks seemed far away. I tried to swim towards the edge, but the more I moved, the more my leg seized up, weighing me down like a block of concrete. I looked around for my mother, and saw her walking along the edge of the other pond. _Ma_ , I cried weakly, but my voice was strangled by the pain and the fear that gripped me. Later \u2013 much later \u2013 I would know that I'd just had cramp, and that if I remained calm it would pass. But that first time I had no idea what was happening to my body, and the terror of the unfamiliar sensation was worse than the pain itself. I began to sink, my mouth and nose dipping below the water. Where were my superhero powers now? The monster was dragging me to the depths of the pond, and I was fighting, but losing.\n\nMy mother must have walked farther away \u2013 I could no longer see her. I called out for her again, loudly now. Again and again. I found strength in my legs and kicked towards the grassy bank closest to me, but I was still sinking. _Maaa!_ I didn't know if I would make it. The monster was ferocious, it had caught hold of my leg and wasn't letting go. I pulled and kicked. I would make it. I would escape the beast, and one day I would return to kill it. My head dipped under the surface, but by then I was no longer afraid, I was close enough to the side of the pond to know that I had won. The creature would not claim me. We would duel another day.\n\nI lay on the grass and looked around for my mother. She was not so far away, on the other side of the second pond, crouching on all fours as she reached into the water to salvage something from under the surface. 'Ma!' I shouted. I wanted to tell her about my ordeal, but she didn't look up, peering instead into the water as she fished around for something I couldn't see. My leg began to relax, and I felt as if I wanted to cry \u2013 out of embarrassment more than anything. I stretched out my leg and stood up. My body felt perfectly normal, as if nothing had happened to it. Why had I reacted so badly? I felt ashamed at having been so afraid, and even wondered if I'd imagined the whole pain. _Call yourself a wuxia hero._ It had been nothing. But my mother hadn't looked up \u2013 she hadn't heard anything.\n\nWe bought twenty tilapia and released them into the ponds. 'They're like us,' my mother said. 'They can survive anywhere.' They sank slowly into the water, as if they were too surprised to swim, and I never saw them apart from when I came to feed them. My mother and I spent even more time outdoors \u2013 now that the vegetables were under control we had to devise ways to chase away the egrets that came to fish in our suddenly fertile ponds. At the start, welded by the invisible ties that bond a mother to a child, I worked in close proximity to her, and she'd give me instructions on how to carry out my tasks, but now we often worked on opposite ends of what we referred to as 'the farm'. That meant calling out to each other, and I soon got used to the fact that she could no longer hear me unless I was standing close by.\n\n'Buy her a hearing aid,' Keong said. I'd become friends with him by then, and \u2013 being older and from the city \u2013 what he said carried weight. In fact I had been thinking of a hearing aid for some time, but I knew we couldn't afford it. When I'd suggested it to my mother she'd said, 'But I can hear just fine.' Which I knew meant: We can't afford to buy anything.\n\n'Leave it to me,' Keong said. 'You're my little brother. I'll fix it for you.'\n\nThe next day, late in the afternoon, I was harvesting some water spinach when I heard an unfamiliar beeping noise \u2013 a scooter coming down the lane that led to our farm, its rider honking insistently. No one ever came our way at that time of the day. The moment I saw the little red scooter I knew it was Keong. He stopped, and beckoned me over.\n\n'I don't want to get mud on the wheels!' he shouted.\n\nI jogged over to him and admired the scooter, a Honda with red and white stripes on its fuel tank. 'You're kidding me! Where'd you get that?'\n\n'Outside the Nasi Kandar shop in Kuala Selangor.'\n\nI knew what he meant, but I still asked, 'You bought it from someone?'\n\n'Dumb fool!' He threw his head back and laughed. 'Of course I didn't buy it. This old guy went in for lunch, wasn't paying attention. I knew he was the type of idiot who wouldn't keep an eye on his bike. I broke the lock and rode off. Easy as anything.' He produced a screwdriver from his pocket and held it in front of my face as proof of his cunning.\n\n'Better not let anyone see you riding it.'\n\n'Relax, brother. I'm taking it down to Klang to sell it right now. New bike like this will attract maaaaaany customers.'\n\n'How much will you get for it?'\n\n'Enough!' he shouted as he rode away. I wanted to call out and tell him he should wear a helmet, but he was already too far away.\n\nThe next day, when my mother and I were packing up the stall in the market, I saw Keong sitting under a tree across the road, smoking a cigarette. He waved at me and I went over to see him.\n\n'Don't let your mother see you hanging out with a scoundrel like me.'\n\n'Think you're such hot shit? She's got better things to worry about than you.'\n\nHe reached into his pocket and drew out a fistful of cash. 'Well, she can stop worrying about her hearing.' He handed me the money, and I put it in my pocket without counting it. I felt the thick bundle pressing against my thigh, and suddenly I felt scared of losing it. What if it fell out of my pocket? What if someone stole it? What if the police knew I had something I shouldn't have had? Later, I'd feel guilty that I didn't feel more shame. That I didn't think, This money isn't mine. This money was stolen. This money belongs to someone else. But at that moment I didn't consider any of those things. The only fear I had was of losing the cash.\n\n'Thanks, Keong,'\n\n'No need to thank your big brother.' He stubbed out his cigarette. 'Now I'm going to take you to the shop in Klang to buy the damn thing. I don't trust a kid like you to do it yourself.'\n\nWe sat on the bus in silence, and later we cycled back to the farm together. He had nothing to do, he said, so he might as well come with me. Get some fresh air. 'Otherwise I'll be bored and get into trouble again.' He took charge of the hearing aid, strapping it tightly to his handlebars with some raffia string he'd brought along specially. 'You're such a bad cyclist,' he said. 'If you fall, you'll fuck everything up. Better that I take it.' He wouldn't let me touch the hearing aid until we were at the front door, and he didn't leave until I'd gone inside the house.\n\nI waited until the next morning to give the new gadget to my mother. She eyed it suspiciously and said, 'But I don't need it, I can hear just fine.' I waited for her to ask me where I'd got it, whereupon I'd tell her the story Keong and I had prepared: that he had an aunt who worked in a shop in town, and who occasionally got to buy unsold stock at bargain prices. But she didn't ask, she just kept turning the small lump of flesh-coloured plastic over in her fingers. 'My friend Keong got it,' I said.\n\n'I don't need it. My hearing is good.'\n\n'Please, Ma. Just try it. If you don't need it I'll sell it.'\n\n'OK. Make sure you get a good price! I'll just use it once, so it'll be like new.'\n\nOf course she never took it off again after that, except to wipe it clean and put it in its box every night before she went to bed. 'I'll keep it in good condition in case you need to resell it,' she'd say from time to time, even a couple of years later when it had begun to malfunction, and would make all sorts of high-pitched screeching noises in the middle of conversations, or in the middle of a working day when we were digging the soil in the vegetable beds. I'd hear that strangled wail drifting in the air, and I'd chuckle at the thought of selling it on to someone else.\n\nThe farm gave us three years of stability, and although we never had enough money to live the way we wanted \u2013 the way people did on TV or in magazines \u2013 we had the sensation of control. We had mastered the small patch of land we owned, were extracting from it everything it was capable of giving us. We sold vegetables and a modest but steady catch of tilapia at the market each week, but we knew that we could never afford to expand the farm. We felt the limits of our potential \u2013 but the presence of those boundaries also felt comforting, in a way. For once we had a sense of our place in the world.\n\nCuriously, the only other time I felt properly rooted to somewhere was when I was in jail. The routine, the frustration that was common to all the inmates, the meaninglessness of time, the absence of options \u2013 I was locked in a space that was mine, and nothing could change that, not even all the books I read to pretend I was somewhere else. I could read stories about life in Brazil or snowy Sweden, but when I finished I'd still be in my cell, just as I was before, the days stretching ahead of me.\n\nThat third year at the farm, people in the village began to talk about the spring tides, but we weren't concerned. When you grow up by the sea in an area like that, the tides are as constant and present as the air around you. You think you know everything about them. You understand how destructive and regenerative they can be. How they carry the boats out to sea and bring them back again. How they swell with the seasons, bringing greater harvests at some times of the year, growing lean at others. When you know something so intimately, you don't fear it. We'd seen the spring tides before, always towards the end of the year, which doesn't make sense because that's not springtime. You'd get a sense that the tides would be higher than usual, because of the way the moon shone \u2013 with an unusual glow, not really brighter than a normal full moon, but with a strange intensity. You wouldn't notice this unless you spent a lot of time studying it \u2013 unless your livelihood depended on it. The winds would gather from the south-west, and you'd know that cyclones were building further north in Asia.\n\nDuring these times, the village would prepare to defend itself against the onslaught of the sea. We'd rebuild the flood defences and move the boats further up the creek. Sometimes the families closest to the sea would move themselves and their belongings into the homes of relatives further inland, and resign themselves to rebuilding their houses once the floods had subsided. They'd done it before, and they'd do it again. It wasn't the end of the world.\n\nPeople said, _Looks like it's going to be bad this year._ They said that every year \u2013 we didn't care too much. Just to be safe, though, my mother and I borrowed sandbags from someone in the village, planning to stack them around the seaward boundary of the farm, three bags high. That would stop the worst of any floods, we thought. They were so heavy it took both of us to lift them. _Wuxia warrior, you have to help this poor villager_ , I told myself as I strained to lift each bag. _Without you the sea monster will claim your mother and all her land._ We hadn't finished building the barrier when my mother pulled a muscle in her back. I could see her struggling, but she was barely able to hold her end of the sandbag. When she bent down to lift the next one with me she let out a sharp cry. _Aie!_ Followed swiftly by a sharp intake of breath. Sucking in the air between her teeth.\n\n'Take a rest, Ma.'\n\n'It's OK, I'm fine.'\n\nBut when she tried again to lift the bag she could hardly move. She bent over, her hands resting on her knees, breathing heavily. I could smell her hot sour breath from where I was standing.\n\n'Ma, please, go and drink some water. I'll finish this.'\n\n'It's OK. Give me a minute.' She tried to stand up straight, but instead sank to the ground. I rushed over, and helped her up to a sitting position, leaning against the low pile of sandbags.\n\n'That's better,' she breathed heavily. 'I'll be OK.'\n\nI looked up at the sky. Rain clouds had gathered out at sea \u2013 thick and slow-rolling, the colour of coal, blotting out the sun and casting a twilight glow across the land, even though it was the middle of the afternoon. We'd already had the first of the rains that year, heavy drizzles that would turn to steady downpours. I continued to drag the sandbags myself, feeling the muscles in my legs and back thicken and strain with each one I lifted into position. My mother remained propped up against the sandbags, watching me. She waved, but made no attempt to get up. We both knew that I would have to finish the barrier on my own. 'Keep going!' she yelled, and pumped her fist. My knees felt as though they would buckle at any moment, but I forced my body to do what it needed to do. I was a _wuxia_ hero. I was invincible. I had to defend us against the monster from the sea. I heard my mother's hearing aid squeal and whine, like the noise of an alien spaceship. I wanted to say, _Don't worry, I'll make sure everything's OK_ , __ but I knew she wouldn't hear me.\n\nHer back was bad for some days, and that Saturday I had to take the vegetables to sell at the market myself. When I got home I started to dig a trench that ran the length of the sandbags, so that if any water penetrated the barrier we'd have a second line of defence. The hard work was worth it, we said \u2013 an investment for the future. It wasn't just for this year, but for all the years ahead. Who knew when the next big tides were going to be? From time to time my mother's back would feel a bit better, and she'd start to work again, but it would give way within minutes, and in the end she had to stay indoors.\n\n'I have no energy,' she complained. 'I'm getting so old.' She must have pulled a major muscle, because the pain was now in her stomach as well as her back. It was true that she hadn't been eating well. The harvests hadn't been good because of the rain \u2013 a lot of vegetables had rotted in the wet soil, and we hadn't been able to sell as much as usual. She'd lost her appetite, and I thought it was because of the stress \u2013 we both did.\n\nWhen the first swells appeared we had no idea the tides would be as strong and high as they turned out to be. I heard the waves gathering in the night, and when I walked out of the house I found my mother already standing on the bank of sandbags, watching the sea rise. The rocky beach a few hundred yards away had been smothered by a foamy wash, and we knew that by morning it would have reached us.\n\n'Better get some sleep,' my mother said. We went back inside and she told me to push some sandbags against the door, 'Just in case,' but we both knew that it was a certainty, not a possibility.\n\nIt was still dark when I heard the noise. The rushing of the wind, I thought. Then a low groaning \u2013 as if a monster had actually emerged from the sea. Then a silence. I didn't think I'd fallen asleep, but I obviously had, because the sounds came to me as hazily as in a dream, and I couldn't be sure of what I was hearing. What woke me was the touch of water. I turned over in bed and let my arm fall over the side. My fingers felt cold and wet. I jolted awake and sat up in bed, looking at the silvery black slick just a few inches below me. It wasn't a dream, I knew that at once. Things were floating in the water \u2013 my canvas shoes, my slippers, some clothes. In the dark they looked like dead fish.\n\nThis is the sea, I thought. _The sea is in my bedroom_.\n\nI stepped off my bed into the cold salty water, slowly, not knowing what to expect underfoot, but it was just the floor of the house, reassuring and solid. I walked to the door, forced open by the water, and into the main room. My mother was already standing there, trying to prise open the door, which was wedged shut by the sandbags. I dipped my arms into the water, lifting my chin to keep my head above the surface, and pulled the sandbags as far as I could. We squeezed through the door and slipped outside. All around us we saw only what we had seen inside the house. The sea.\n\nThere was no distinction in the landscape \u2013 everything had turned to water. We waded waist-deep, trying to figure out the strangeness of our new world. Underfoot, everything felt uncertain. Where was the concrete platform outside the house, or the line of heavy earthenware pots in which we grew herbs? The sea had consumed everything. All we could see was the swirling surface of the water, as slick as petrol. We looked out into the dark and could not discern the vegetable plots or the ponds or the sandbags, or even the bushes and trees around the farm. Neither of us spoke. We walked until the ground beneath our feet became too soft and uncertain for us to continue, and then headed back to the house, which at least offered us a sense of boundaries, with its walls and roof, even though it was no longer the house we had known just a few hours previously.\n\n'What are we going to do, Ma?' I asked.\n\nShe didn't answer. At first I thought it was because she was in shock. That she was too scared to answer. Then I realised she wasn't wearing her hearing aid, and couldn't hear what I was saying. She hadn't had time to put it in before the tide arrived, and now it was lost in the floodwater.\n\nWe found the ladder and climbed up onto the roof with as many things as we could gather from the cupboards \u2013 anything that hadn't yet been claimed by the water. Two candles. Some clothes, bundled up in a raffia bag. Biscuits. The tin of money that represented all our savings. We'd seen it floating in the water, knocking against the wall of my mother's bedroom as if to remind us it was there. The tiles of the roof were slippery, but at the top there was a flat concrete ledge that we could straddle comfortably.\n\nFrom our vantage point we began to reconfigure what we understood of the land in which we lived. The place that was once our home. The sea had erased everything we had thought unmoveable. Scrubbed it all out and absorbed it. Our ponds, full of fish. Our farm. All of that was now part of the sea. As we waited for daybreak my mother pulled me close to her. The wind was gusting, blowing patterns on the surface of the water, sometimes ruffling it into waves. Occasionally there would be a surge in the sea, and the entire watery landscape would tremble and swell. At last the skies began to lighten, turning a faint blue-grey.\n\nI can only recall that first spring tide in any detail. There was another one the year after, less powerful; and another the following year, stronger even than the first. The others felt inevitable, as if they were predestined. That first year, the waters subsided a few days later, and we tried to rebuild what we had lost. The second year, we didn't even try. _Global warming_ , people said \u2013 strong tide surges would be normal from now on. Apply for a subsidy or loan to buy a new place, someone in the village suggested half-heartedly. But even at that age I knew, like everyone else, that it was hopeless. We were the wrong race, the wrong religion \u2013 who was going to give us any help? Not the government, that's for sure. We knew that for no-money Chinese people like us, there was no point in even trying.\n\nIt didn't matter. By that time my mother's stomach and back pains had got so bad that one day she collapsed on the street in Kuala Selangor and had to be taken to hospital. She'd been stressed, she hadn't been eating properly, she told the nurse when she woke up in the ward. But what she had thought was due to her bad diet turned out to be a tumour in her colon the size of a small apple. The doctor was angry. 'Why didn't you get it checked earlier?' she yelled at me. 'It's been growing for at least ten years,' she said, pointing at the fuzzy circle on the x-rays that she held in front of my face as if it was my fault. I just shrugged. She explained that there were treatments in KL or Singapore that might possibly shrink the tumour, but she wasn't all that hopeful. My mother said she didn't want to see any more doctors, that she needed to face her destiny. She tried to make her reasoning sound Buddhist, but the truth was that we had no means of paying for the hospitals. She struggled on for another year before her body gave up. I'd already made the decision to leave for KL to find work. Her death made it easy for me to leave what was left of the land and the house we owned.\n\nWhen I think back to that period of our lives, what comes to mind isn't the floods or the way the farm looked after the water had subsided, flattened by a blanket of grey mud and sea-sand. It isn't the storms, or the house with its cracked walls. It isn't the early promise of wealth either, when my mother's market stall was doing well and she came home every day with bags of sweets and cakes as a treat. What I remember is our days working on the farm \u2013 my silly, happy fantasies of being a martial-arts hero wandering the countryside slaying beasts and helping the oppressed. In these images that come back to me, clear as sunlight, I am slashing away at the dense foliage, or digging the thick mud. I feel like a hero. I am a hero. I look up and see my mother by the ponds. Squatting so she's close to the ground, repairing the small nets she'll soon throw over the water to snare the week's catch. Her hearing aid is playing up, crackling with static and squealing its high-pitched whine. I don't know why I'm smiling.\n\n## III\n\n## DECEMBER\n\n##\n\n_December 4th_\n\nThe encampment lay in a scrubby bit of forest, scattered among the trees and bushes, clearly visible from the road. A row of tarpaulins was stretched between tree trunks just a few yards from the edge of the road \u2013 grey-brown canvas and bright-blue plastic sheets that you couldn't fail to notice if you were driving along the long, straight route that linked the plantation towns to the highway, and further on to the coast. It was a road like any other in the area, cutting through palm-oil estates and scrubland and patches of forest. Occasionally you'd see a small abandoned wooden shelter that might once have been a bus stop, or a food stall. You could be driving down the road, make a turn at a crossroads, and suddenly find yourself on another, identical stretch of cracked tarmac, and soon you'd be lost. You wouldn't be sure if the makeshift camp you glimpsed between the trees was the same one you saw twenty minutes before. In any case, there are so many of these kinds of temporary dwelling places in this part of the country. So many temporary workers. If you want to hide a large group of men, this is the best way to do it: in full view of anyone who chooses to notice them.\n\nEven though Keong knew where the camp was, we sped right past, and had to reverse a few hundred yards to get back to it. I was driving, and Keong was smoking, making his way steadily through his pack of Salems. We were always taking small detours to track down shops that sold them. He was fussy, wouldn't smoke anything else. The window was down, but the hot air that swirled around the car didn't seem to chase away the smoke. It had taken us only two brief meetings to fall into an established pattern \u2013 I drove, while Keong smoked and talked constantly. First time, it was because he had a problem with his car. The next time it was because he said he wanted to appreciate the landscape. 'It's been so long. I realise now that I really miss this place.'\n\nHe'd point out things he remembered from the past, from way back in the nineties \u2013 a stretch of jungle that flooded one year, when the rains didn't stop for three days and nights, and the rivers and monsoon drains overflowed. For a few days afterwards, under heavy grey skies, the trunks of the trees were submerged, with only their leaves protruding from the muddy water like giant origami decorations floating on the surface of a pond. A dirt track where a wild boar charged at us while we were cycling early one evening. _It had its babies with it, it was aggressive, it really scared us!_ The stretch of the main road where he had his first crash on his scooter \u2013 lorries carrying their loads of palm-oil seeds would squeeze him too close to the concrete kerb, and more than a few times he'd been forced off the road. Once he ended up in a ditch. There \u2013 the noodle place he'd taken that girl to on his first date, my God, what was her name?\n\nI let him talk. I nodded. Sometimes I laughed, just to give him the impression that I was confirming the clarity of his memories. I never had the heart to tell him that he'd got it wrong \u2013 that the stretch of jungle he remembered had been cut down years ago, the trees felled in the space of a week to make way for a new plantation that was now so mature, the palm-oil trees so tall, that it seemed to have belonged to that landscape since the beginning of time. The noodle stall he talked about was actually on the other side of Sekinchan, and it too had disappeared years ago. How do you expect a ramshackle place like that to survive more than a few years? As for other details \u2013 maybe he was right. I don't remember exactly where we were when we crossed paths with the mother wild boar and her babies, or where we saw a monitor lizard eating the carcass of a goat. I just nodded in agreement when Keong dredged up those memories. They'd ceased to matter to me.\n\nHe wouldn't stop talking about the past, and soon I found myself driving faster than I should have, just to reach our destination and put an end to our one-sided conversation. That was why I went past the camp without realising it was where we were meant to stop. He was still talking as we got out of the car \u2013 recounting one of the endless antics of Auntie Ah Hua, who had developed a taste for whisky after her marriage broke up, and used up all her savings on Johnnie Walker Red Label and Mekhong, and often appeared drunk at the temple, which everyone thought was funny \u2013 while I strode on ahead. I could barely remember those events.\n\n'What is this place?' I asked.\n\n'It's where the workers stay before they move into their permanent jobs.'\n\n'So what kind of work are they doing right now?'\n\nKeong lit another cigarette, and shook the box to see how many he had left. Almost none. 'You dumb or what? They've got no work yet. Why do you think I'm so stressed? Twenty men sitting around doing nothing for three weeks. Think of the money I'm losing.'\n\nThe camp looked deserted. The air was cloudy with the last remnants of an open fire slowly dying in the sticky air \u2013 I got the feeling that someone had thrown damp leaves on the embers to hide its glow. The smoke that rose from the pile of foliage and ash was thin and blue, and made the shapes that lay in the shade of the tarpaulins indistinct. But as we got close to the first of the shelters I noticed movement through the haze. One of those dead mounds \u2013 of earth? Of vegetation? \u2013 began to move, and a man emerged from the gloom.\n\n'Haven't heard from you in two days.' He addressed Keong in bad Malay, mixed up with some words from a foreign language I didn't understand. In fact he said something like, _Two days something something never something call phone_. But I could make out what he meant all the same.\n\n'Been busy.'\n\n'We're out of food. The men haven't eaten since yesterday morning. Had to walk to the stream to get water. Some of them are sick.'\n\nKeong kept striking his lighter, but the air was so humid that the flame wouldn't catch. 'Let me see them.'\n\nAs we walked through the camp the motionless shapes under the tarpaulins began to stir and unfurl into human form, men \u2013 all men \u2013 stretching into life, sitting up, coughing, running their hands across their faces. A few of them looked at us, and though I returned their glances I looked away quickly. Our eyes barely met, but in those two, three seconds, I knew that we shared something. A sense of shame. A desire to flee \u2013 to escape that camp, that forest, that country, the whole universe that made that life possible. Did they avert their gaze before I did? One of us blinked first and lowered our head to avoid seeing the other, but I couldn't tell who it was. Probably me. I didn't need to examine them any closer to figure out what they were, or what they were doing there \u2013 I didn't need Keong or anyone else to explain. Once they realised that they were in no immediate danger, they lay back down and continued to rest. What else could they do, I thought. Rest.\n\n'They're not the ones we're looking for,' Keong said as we drove away.\n\n'They're Bangladeshi?' I asked.\n\n'That's where most of the labour comes from these days. Many from Myanmar and Nepal too, but in this area I handle mainly Bangladesh and Indons. Better for plantation work.'\n\nI didn't ask any questions. At that point I was still hoping that Keong would go away and leave me in peace, and I didn't want to show any interest in his business.\n\nOn the drive back to Klang he explained that he worked as a 'labour contractor', that his employers were a company \u2013 a real, proper company with an office \u2013 that brought in people from all sorts of companies to work in all sorts of jobs. Construction sites, plantations \u2013 but these days also hotels, restaurants, toilet cleaners, you name it. The kind of work that locals don't have the taste for these days \u2013 and even if we did, what employer would give us the work? They can get two Bangladeshis for the price of one local. 'It's like at the supermarket,' said Keong. 'Who can resist the buy-one-get-one-free offer? That's why they're everywhere. Walk into any shop or eating place and a foreigner will be serving you.'\n\n'Really? I don't see so many Bangladeshis around here,' I said.\n\n'You must be blind. Anyway, up in KL they're everywhere. The other day I was waiting for my wife at the hair salon and I heard an old woman say, \"I don't want a foreigner touching me, I don't want that dark-skinned person touching my hair.\" And I couldn't help myself, I said, \" _Wei_ , Auntie, better get used to it, because dark-skinned foreigners are here to stay. No one else going to be shampooing your hair any time soon.\"'\n\nWhenever his company got calls from a construction site or a plantation, Keong told me, he would contact the labour brokers and say, 'How many Bangladeshis or Burmese can you get me by next month?' Or, 'I need eight men and six women for a new hotel in Johor by next Wednesday. Can?' _A middleman_. I thought it sounded like a suitable job for him. He didn't come in with any ideas at either end of the deal, he just got things sorted out in between. The messy stuff that no one else wanted to do \u2013 that was always his strength.\n\nThe brokers were the ones who got the men into the country, and Keong's company was responsible for the paperwork. Keong himself didn't do any administration. 'You know how bad I was at school \u2013 reading papers and contracts, that's not for me.' But any old fool could do that work. What Keong did was far more important, according to him at least. He had to go out into the field, drive around the country for days, making sure the foreigners were in half-decent shape when they turned up for their first day's work. Give them enough food in the three or four days before they start their jobs. Patch them up if they've got any wounds or bruises. Can't show anything ugly, no raw flesh, obvious fractures, that sort of thing \u2013 no employer likes to see men riddled with disease or carrying too many injuries. Women even more so \u2013 they have to look washed and clean. Thank goodness there weren't that many women in the plantations. God knows what women have been through by the time they got to this country. 'I wouldn't like to be the one in charge of getting them in shape,' Keong said. 'But someone out there has to. Sit down in your seafood restaurant in KL and the Myanmar girl who's serving you \u2013 well, chances are she didn't look like that when she stepped off the boat.'\n\n_Give them enough food. Patch them up_. I thought of the people in the camp and wondered if any of them had open wounds. I drove fast down the narrow straight road. I was impatient to reach the wide lanes and streaming traffic of the highway. The sooner I got there, the sooner I'd leave Keong and his mess behind. I lowered all the windows to get rid of the smoke from his cigarettes. 'You're the same as before, always judging,' Keong said. 'What I do is a proper business \u2013 just like yours. You think it's dirty work, don't you?'\n\nI hesitated. 'I don't care what you do. It just seems a bit complicated to me. We never have these kinds of problems hiring workers at the farm.'\n\n'Problems? What do you mean? Motherfucker. How do you find guys to work, then?'\n\n'Mostly they're friends or relatives of people who already work for us. They know we pay on time \u2013 not a lot, but always on time. They get days off, holidays. Sometimes they just turn up out of nowhere. They walk into the farm and ask for work, we ask to see their foreign worker's card, that's it. We don't need to go through middlemen and brokers and all that nonsense.'\n\n' _Sor hai_ ,' Keong laughed. 'You run a shitty little fish farm and you think you understand everything. Little guy, let me tell you, we supply workers to all the plantations. The biggest ones. They need dozens, hundreds of men at a time. The palm oil gets exported to China, the US, Europe \u2013 everywhere. Those imported American cookies you see in the supermarket, the ones you can't afford to buy \u2013 all made with our palm oil. You see, I'm working in an _international business_. And you think you can look down on me? Makes me laugh.'\n\n'I like my job. I don't need to work for an international company to be happy.'\n\nHe didn't answer.\n\nWe kept the windows down even on the highway. The noise of the traffic filled the car, swirling around us just like the smoke from Keong's cigarettes, but its presence was comforting. I thought, Now he'll leave me in peace. Now he realises at last that we've become different people.\n\n*\n\nIn truth I should have known, even on the first day of our so-called reunion, that he was going to be hanging around for a while. When we left Ah Chan's that evening, we drove into town separately, me following him as he led the way. I didn't know where he was taking me; it was just like the old days, only now we were in cars, not on scooters. He wanted to have a few drinks, sing a few songs at a KTV place, and we ended up at K-Fire Karaoke. I heard it closed down some years ago, and I'm not surprised. Got raided too many times. It looked just like any other karaoke joint, but back then even I knew what kind of reputation it had. At the farm, visiting contractors used to refer to it with a smile. They talked about going there after dinner 'for some dessert'. You had to ask discreetly, you had to look like the kind of man who'd spend a lot of money, not someone like me. There'd be women, young and not so young, who'd serve you drinks. What happened after that was up to you and your hostess. 'It's a free market,' I'd hear people say. 'You can do whatever deal you want.'\n\nBut that night Keong didn't want to do any deals. He didn't ask for any girls, didn't even look at passing women the way he used to when he was younger, didn't stare and make comments. He ordered a bottle of Johnnie Walker, which we didn't finish. All he wanted to do was sing. Danny Chan Pak-keung. The entire repertoire. Sometimes he stood up, holding the mike as if he was on stage, performing in a huge auditorium, his arms spreading swanlike as if he wanted to embrace the entire audience. _So why do I still keep on secretly loving you_ he sang, facing the screen and closing his eyes as if addressing the words to himself. His voice was rough, gritty, even more so than before, and I remembered him singing the same songs more than a decade previously, when we were hanging around the streets of the capital every night, that big-city life that seemed so full of promise. Sometimes, in the half-dark of that padded KTV room, in the middle of a song, Keong would turn away from his imaginary audience and look at me while singing a line or two, and I'd notice how much he'd aged since we last met.\n\nAnd then I was singing too, with a mike in my hand, joining in the chorus to a few of the songs. I don't know how that happened, I'd only had two drinks, and I hadn't even finished the second one. Somebody opened the door and stumbled into the room \u2013 a middle-aged man with his shirt half-unbuttoned, mumbling, 'Darling, where are you?' before falling into an armchair. We helped him up and pushed him out into the corridor again. We were laughing. The music was playing loudly; we hadn't bothered to stop the disc. Keong sat down, breathing heavily, and eased his wallet from his trouser pocket. He paused for a while before opening it and showing me a photo, tucked neatly behind a plastic cover.\n\n'My wife and baby,' he said. I couldn't see clearly in the gloom \u2013 the photo was hazy in the flickering light of the TV screen. Three people. A man, a woman with a young child in her arms, shot against a blue background in a studio. The man didn't even look like Keong \u2013 he was neatly dressed in a long-sleeved shirt, buttoned all the way to the collar. I thought of showing him a photo of Jenny, but the moment seemed wrong.\n\nI said, 'That's nice.'\n\nHe leaned back in the chair and sipped his drink. 'I want to make some cash and start my own business. Make life good for my wife and kid. Emigrate to California. Australia. Wherever. Somewhere I don't have to do this shit.'\n\n'Thought you loved your big-time job. You must be making decent money.'\n\nHe stared at the screen, which was playing the kind of karaoke video that doesn't make any sense at all, just home-made shots of people walking in parks. He looked almost sad as he turned to me and said, 'I have a problem.'\n\nAs he talked his voice lowered slightly, as if softened by doubt. By reality. And that made him seem more certain, more truthful, than I could remember. He'd been wanting to leave his job for some time now, but he couldn't afford to. The work was tiring, he was on the road many days at a time, sometimes a week, ten days. He didn't see his family enough. He'd go away to visit a plantation in Kedah or Johor, and when he came back his daughter would have learned another few words. Once he came home after a long trip up north and she spoke in a full sentence. He had the feeling he was missing out on things. On the small things that made up this thing we call life. One day he got into a fight with some Burmese guys who hadn't been paid in a while. They were demanding their money, but Keong hadn't even known about the situation, so he stood his ground. _You know what I'm like_. They roughed him up before disappearing into the jungle. No one could find them \u2013 not the police, not the other workers, but in truth no one tried very hard. Guess who got the blame? Five lost men \u2013 that's a lot of money. His employers were furious. Worse still, try explaining to your small child why you've got a bloody bruise on your face. _Papa fell down. Stupid Papa!_ She just stared at him, blinking. Then her face crumpled and she started to cry. Wouldn't stop crying. That was when he thought, I must get out.\n\nNow there was another matter. Eighteen missing workers. Keong's company had already paid for these men, but they never turned up. That was why he was back down here, to try to find the men and sort things out with the broker, the guy who shipped them in from abroad. If he could clear things up, his boss had promised him a bonus. When he got that money, dear God, he would resign the very next day and start his own business. He'd already thought of a plan: his uncle had connections with factories in China that made clothing for Western luxury brands. He'd heard they threw tons of clothes away \u2013 one bad stitch and a perfectly good item would be rejected. Keong would buy all those rejects and sell them here at knockdown prices.\n\nStill staring at the screen, he said, 'Will you help me?'\n\n'How the hell can I help?'\n\n'You know people down here. You know all the plantations. You hear things. I'm an outsider now. If I go around asking questions, no one will help me. You're a local.'\n\nI laughed. 'In your dreams. I have a quiet life now. I don't know anyone.' I stood up to leave. It wasn't late, but my head was hurting and I had an early start at the farm the next day.\n\n'I'm all on my own here,' Keong said. His voice had dropped so low that I could barely hear him over the music. Outside, muffled, off-key voices came from the other rooms. On the screen, a carefree young couple were running through the Lake Gardens, or some other pleasant park with a boating lake in the background. They looked impossibly happy, and slightly out of focus, as people always are in those sorts of videos. I left without saying goodbye, honestly thinking that was the last time I would see Keong.\n\n##\n\nI'm writing a book, she says.\n\nBook? What book.\n\nAbout you.\n\nI pause. What for? I thought you were doing research for your PhD.\n\nWell, I am. But, umm, I'm sort of thinking of turning it into a book? She says this as if it's a question. Only it isn't a question.\n\nWhat kind of book? I say.\n\nIt's a bit hard to describe, she replies. Something between biography and journalism. Narrative non-fiction, I guess. That's what I'd call it. Or maybe true crime, only, well, different. Better. I don't know. Publishers have so many strange ways of marketing books these days.\n\nPublishers? I repeat the word as if I've never heard it before. I know I'm coming across as stupid \u2013 that I'm turning the conversation into a sort of merry-go-round, where every so often we have to pass a point where I say, _What book?_ Or _Publishers?_ _Narrative what?_\n\nYou're kidding, right? I say. A book about me? My little life? No one's going to be interested in that.\n\nYou'd be surprised. I think a lot of people would be interested.\n\nYou're nuts.\n\nThe point is this. I need your permission before I can publish anything.\n\nWhy? You can do anything you like. I don't care.\n\nWell, I do care. I wouldn't do anything unauthorised. I'd feel very uncomfortable acting without your blessing. It's your story, not mine. You should have the final say about whether it gets released into the world or not.\n\nI pause and look at her. She smiles. That same smile that transforms not just her face but the entire room, scrubbing out any possibility of sadness.\n\nA book, huh? What a crazy idea.\n\n##\n\n_December 7th_\n\nDid you read in the newspapers a few months ago about a man who went berserk and killed his entire family? Up in Penang. They ran a small chicken factory \u2013 the kind of place where live chickens are delivered to be slaughtered, cleaned and packed for sale in the supermarkets. The family lived in two shipping containers inside the factory, one stacked on top of the other. Their entire home consisted of these two metal bedrooms. I couldn't make out from the photos whether they had any windows or not \u2013 I don't think the photographer was interested in capturing anything other than the blood on the mattresses. The man \u2013 a young guy around thirty, I think \u2013 turns up at the factory and gets into an argument with his mother and her boyfriend. It's 2 a.m., and the workers in the factory are getting ready for a long shift slaughtering and plucking chickens. Imagine that, plucking chickens while it's still dark outside every day of your life. Machines are whirring all around them, the chickens squawking their heads off. The workers don't think anything about it \u2013 the guy's got a temper, he's always shouting at his mother. His brother hears the commotion and comes down from the top container. He's carrying his two-year-old son, who's sleeping in his arms. We don't know what the argument is about. Suddenly the guy pulls out a handgun, a 9mm pistol, and shoots them all. Point blank. From that range, you can't miss. Then he drives off in a Toyota Hilux and the police can't find him. Maybe he just drove over the bridge and up into Kedah and Thailand \u2013 who knows. And all that time, the Nepalese workers are plucking those squawking birds while the family are lying dead in their cramped shipping containers.\n\nPolice ask everyone who knew the family, but no one knows for sure why he did it. Killing a stranger is one thing, but your own mother? Your brother? His baby kid? Some people say it must have been drugs. Others that it was over money. Others that it was because he hated his mother's boyfriend. Others that it was shame. Mother gives him thousands of bucks to fund his chicken stall at the market, but then one day some guy from City Hall turns up and takes everything away because there's a problem with his licence. He's lost all his money \u2013 his mother's money \u2013 and doesn't know what went wrong. Maybe he didn't bribe the right person, maybe he forgot to fill in part of some form, but whatever the case, his business is finished, and he's so ashamed he can't face the family. Can't look at them without feeling a terrible pain somewhere in his skull. Every time they stare at him it's as if they're accusing him \u2013 of what he doesn't quite know, but they're accusing him. Of everything.\n\nBut the truth is that there is no _because_. And because there is no _because_ , there is also no _why_. He did what he did. Sometimes things happen that way. Or maybe the _because_ was buried so far in his past that it's impossible to figure out what it is, so it ceases to be real. For many months, while waiting for my trial, and afterwards in prison, I tried to find the reasons behind what I did. I tried to excavate the layers of my thoughts, my memories, digging patiently the way I used to in the mud on our farm when I was a child, and later at the fish farm. Sometimes you hit a layer of rock, other times the mud was compacted so solidly that your _cangkul_ couldn't dig through it, no matter how high you raised it over your head, how hard you brought it crashing down into the earth. That was how I felt. I wasn't going to give up. I would sit on my bed with my eyes closed, sinking deeper into the mess of people and sounds in my head, of events lasting five seconds or five years, trying to recall anything in my past that might have given me a clue to why I'd done what I did. A reason for those five, ten seconds. When you have so much time on your hands there's little else to do. But those hours, those long nights alone, searching \u2013 they yielded nothing. That's why I don't question myself in the same way these days. Prayers are all I need. There's no point in questioning God's will.\n\nThe month Keong reappeared in Klang, I was busier at work than I'd ever been. The farm had just taken a huge order from a supermarket chain in Singapore, but Mr Lai's mood was as bad as ever. Said he was stressed. 'Stressed from success,' Jezmine said without looking up from her computer screen one day. 'You men are useless. Business is bad, you get grumpy. Business is good, you get grumpy. Can't handle anything. Look at him \u2013 doesn't even have time to dress himself properly or comb his hair in the morning. I can't even look at him these days, all that dandruff on his shoulders.' She laughed as she scribbled a note on a piece of paper \u2013 she wrote so quickly, typed even faster. 'Lucky your wife takes care of you,' she said to me. 'At least you look presentable.'\n\nOutside, we could see Mr Lai gesticulating at some of the Indonesian workers. They weren't working hard enough, he'd complained to me, and it was true, a few of them seemed slower than usual. We were building more ponds and installing an irrigation system to fulfil the order from Singapore \u2013 a long-term contract with payment guaranteed every quarter. I'd devised the new pumps, imagined how the water would flow across the land, filling the hollows in the earth. I thought of my mother, bent over with a shovel in her hands, scooping out mounds of wet mud from our fields. I remembered our little farm, which wasn't even a farm but a stretch of soil and thorns, and thought how it might have looked if we'd had the technology I was now building, and the absurdity of it made me smile. That miserable unyielding land would never have given us anything, no matter what we did to it. Earth and water \u2013 that was my livelihood once again, but now I had money and machines on my side.\n\nEven Mr Lai was happy with my plan, and promised to give all the men a two-hundred-ringgit bonus when the construction works were completed. 'I'm such a softie,' he said, 'always paying you guys too much.' He never promised to give me a bonus, though, and I wasn't expecting one. It was enough for me to see that the men were working well, darting across the yard, joking as they worked. Two hundred bucks isn't a lot of money to you, and not even to them \u2013 let's face it, even a packet of fried noodles in a shitty roadside stall costs five ringgit a throw, so how long can that kind of cash last? But in these kinds of jobs, small gestures like that mean something. They signify kindness, even though the person making the gesture doesn't do it out of kindness but as a sort of automated response. I remembered my time in KL, working as a waiter. Sometimes people would give me one, two ringgit as a tip, and for some minutes afterwards I'd be walking with more energy and being just a bit more polite to customers than usual. They'd hand me the notes without even looking at me, but still, I'd feel that I was important. That I existed.\n\nThe first days of the new works started in this way, but then there was a change \u2013 as swift as a thunderstorm on a hot afternoon. One day the workers were fine, the next they had slowed down to a near stop. Tasks that usually took a couple of hours, like digging a small trench or repairing the floating cages, lasted nearly a whole day. I tried to reassign them to different jobs, change the workload, but often I'd find them sitting on the bare earth, in a patch of shade under a tree, heads bowed. The patient rise and fall of their shoulders as they breathed. Even the air seemed to weigh down on them.\n\n'What the fuck?' Mr Lai said every time he saw them. 'I paid for men, not livestock. Look at them, just sitting under the trees like goats!'\n\n'What's up with you guys?' I asked several times, but nobody would answer. They just shrugged and looked away. 'Sack them, hire new ones,' Mr Lai said. He was spending all day on his mobile phone, and it seemed like wherever we were on the farm we could hear his voice, clattering away like a machine gun, always on the verge of shouting. I wouldn't fire the men, I'd replied, I'd clear things up. Besides, these men knew the farm, they knew me. I'd never had a problem with any of them.\n\n'They're sick, they probably caught colds when they had to work in the rain last week,' I said. The winds that week had been very heavy \u2013 the tail end of the typhoon that blew down from the Philippines. 'Just give them a few days, they'll get better quickly.'\n\nOne by one, in the space of two, three days, they all succumbed to a lethargy that I'd never seen in them before. Their mouths were hanging open. Eyes bloodshot and sinking into their sockets. Lips cracked as if they'd been shipwrecked on a desert island. They were always drinking water, but it was never enough, and sometimes they'd hold the hosepipe above their heads and gulp down as much as they could. Still, they didn't get better. By the end of the week half of them weren't showing up for work, and the ones who did could barely walk from one end of the farm to the other without sitting down to rest. In the meantime the works we had started lay virtually abandoned, the earth scarred with half-dug pits filled with rainwater and beginning to collapse in on themselves. Piles of nets and wire, rolls of black tarpaulin. Men sitting half-asleep in the shade. Around us, the black stumps of trees we'd cut down and poisoned so the roots would die.\n\nWhen I asked Hendro what was wrong with him, he shrugged and said, 'Stomach ache.' His cheeks were sunken; he seemed to have lost ten pounds in two days.\n\n'You can't stop work just because of a stomach ache.'\n\nHe shook his head. _Muntah, muntah_. He made an action with his hand in front of his mouth to indicate vomiting. Lots of vomiting. Everyone was vomiting. In the village where they lived, someone had started vomiting and having violent diarrhoea one night. By the end of the next day, three other people were sick with the same symptoms, the day after it was ten, then twenty, and now everyone who lived there was ill, nearly fifty people in total. I'd seen where they lived, I'd driven past it, on the outskirts of the port area, and it wasn't surprising that they were all ill. One tap for all the inhabitants, the drains clogged with black water. Cats picking through small heaps of rubbish. Children playing with sticks and pieces of string, lines of washing hanging outside the houses, sagging under the weight of clothes that looked grey even after they'd been cleaned. You know the type of place I mean \u2013 you drive past them in two seconds and you don't even notice them. Funny how people use that word \u2013 _kampung_ \u2013 when what they mean isn't a village in the countryside, surrounded by trees and flowers, but a semi-slum, a shanty without amenities except for one or two cheap generators that everyone chips in to feed with diesel now and then.\n\n'You have cholera,' I said. I'd seen the symptoms before; there had been an outbreak in the village when I was small, and nearly all the children had fallen sick. Suddenly I felt sweaty, a slight shiver ran down my neck. I thought of all the things we'd touched that day \u2013 the oil drums, the packs of fish feed, the shovels \u2013 and wondered if I had cholera germs on my hands too. I wondered if I was going to be sick. I wondered if they were going to die. In the washroom I cleaned my hands with soap as thoroughly as I could, twice, three times. I found some bleach and poured a few drops into the basin and filled it with water before soaking my hands in it, submerging half my forearms. The sharp smell of chlorine on my skin afterwards felt reassuring; it followed me around for the rest of the day.\n\nLater, I got all the men together in the yard and told them to go home. 'Go see a doctor!' I shouted as they trudged off, knowing that they wouldn't because they couldn't afford to. It wouldn't even cross their minds. I remembered how it felt. If you were sick like that, you just waited to get better, and if you didn't, well, there was nothing you could do about it. I looked at the pools of stagnant water collecting on the ground. Collapsing trenches of grey sludge. No doubt the men had relieved themselves in them, and now there was cholera in the water, seeping into the red soil everywhere around us, into the fish enclosures, into the rivers and the sea beyond.\n\nMr Lai rang from Kuantan \u2013 he was on the east coast looking for more business ('Hunting for more stress,' Jezmine said) \u2013 and asked how it was going, whether I'd hired more men.\n\n_How the hell could I hire ten men just like that?_ I felt like shouting down the phone. You think they're just going to appear out of thin air? That's not the way things work. You have to ask the guys if they have any friends, a cousin from their village back home, someone reliable. We needed ten men to finish the job in time, maybe fifteen. Now we had maybe two healthy ones. There was no hope for us.\n\n'Everything's OK,' I lied. 'By the time you get back next week, you'll see the difference.'\n\n' _Die lor!_ ' Jezmine screamed with laughter as I hung up. 'You're in big trouble. Don't count on me to help you with your lies.'\n\nAt home that evening I couldn't concentrate on anything, couldn't even keep up with the story of _Winter Sonata_ , which we were watching again. Jenny had bought the DVDs from some counterfeit place, with Japanese subtitles, so we couldn't understand any of the Korean words. It didn't matter \u2013 we'd seen the entire series years before, when we were dating, and had found those tragic love stories romantic. I guess that's why Jenny had bought the DVDs, to remember how it was to be moved by the beauty of love affairs that don't work out. By the failure of love. I wasn't keen on the idea at first \u2013 why watch something you've already seen? \u2013 but from the very first episode, I was the one who was hooked, more so than I remember having been the first time round. Those frosty northern landscapes, people wrapped up in scarves. The idea of someone not remembering his past, becoming someone entirely new because he no longer had his memory. Oh, the poor unloved young man. And yet, love remained in his heart!\n\nJenny kept making noises \u2013 snorting, laughing quietly at the most tender moments, sighing impatiently when the characters looked at each other for a long time without saying anything. Sometimes she'd make the odd comment. _Ridiculous. Just hurry up. Hei, little girl, just move on, forget about the past._ She'd pick up a magazine and read it. But still, I knew she was sneaking a glance at the screen now and then. Why else would she have sat watching it with me almost every night?\n\n'What's the matter?' she asked that evening.\n\n'Nothing,' I said. 'Nothing's wrong.'\n\nShe leaned against me and put her head on my shoulder, as if she needed comforting, when in fact we both knew that I was the one who was troubled.\n\n'This episode is really boring,' she said. 'I don't believe anyone can just turn up in America and become a famous architect.'\n\n'You're so cynical,' I laughed, putting my arm around her.\n\n'I mean, one minute you're just some Korean kid, next minute you're a hotshot architect in the States... just because you had a car crash?'\n\n' _Ya lor_ , that's what happens in TV dramas.'\n\nShe sighed \u2013 a long, slow breath that seemed to fill the room. She closed her eyes and mumbled as if she was getting ready for sleep. 'I don't know what's happened to me. These days I only find real life interesting, not all this made-up nonsense.'\n\nLater, as I lay in bed, I thought of the workers at the farm, the cholera drying them to their bones, their eyes dark and bulging. Staring at me. I tried to ignore the germs in the water, spreading everywhere. I thought of pouring concrete into all the holes, covering the entire surface of the farm with cement \u2013 was that even possible? Driving the cholera deep underground until it suffocated and died. I didn't know if cholera breathed. Or maybe I'd burn it. Set the whole place on fire and rebuild it all within a week. I imagined the flames sweeping across the flat land, cleansing everything in their path before moving on in search of something else to consume and transform. They would leave only me in their wake, but that would be enough. One solitary human being who would resurrect the whole damn place. Mr Lai would come back and find new, healthy men, a farm transformed beyond recognition. He'd stand there and say, _You are a genuine wuxia superhero_.\n\nIn the dark, Jenny turned over and her hand brushed my arm. I wished I could sleep, I didn't want to wake her. I lay perfectly still with my eyes closed. The men. Water. Earth. I listened to Jenny's breathing, and knew that she wasn't asleep either.\n\n##\n\n_December 9th_\n\nI decided to call Keong the next day, when all twelve men were so sick that none of them could come to work. Jezmine came out from the office and stood with me as I surveyed the farm \u2013 the uncompleted jobs dotting the land with piles of bare earth and sand. Two concrete mixers, a stack of timber beams. In the distance the automatic systems continued to pump water through the ponds, but the fish wouldn't last more than a couple of days without being fed. In the shed, the fingerlings needed tending to. Someone had to check the filtration systems, make sure the water didn't become too hard, or too salty, or too hot or cold \u2013 any of which could kill the tiny fish and lose us thousands. I looked at the enclosures, neatly divided into squares by the wooden walkways, and I'm sure Jezmine knew what I was thinking: could I do it all by myself for a whole week? I'm sure she also knew the answer.\n\n'Two of us won't be able to cope, right?' she said.\n\nI shook my head. In truth it might have been possible in the past, when I was a younger, different person. I knew that if I'd arrived early and got into my work clothes I could have started the rounds before Jezmine arrived, pushing a wheelbarrow filled with feed around the enclosures. If I'd started at seven, before it was properly light, and finished twelve hours later, when it was beginning to get dark, I could have done it. And the next day, and the next. But even as my thoughts began to fall into place and devise a plan of action, I knew that my body was no longer capable of performing such tasks. I thought of some of the workers I'd met in the past, older than me, who'd still been working on farms and construction sites, outdoors the whole day. I remembered their hands, bony and strong. Their milky eyes. Then one day they'd just disappear. Gone back to Palembang or Sylhet or wherever they came from. Or died from a heart attack at the age of forty. One day you're working on a building site for a new mall, you look up and the sky is white, no haze, just pure sunlight, and suddenly your chest tightens and you drop dead. It happens all the time.\n\nI knew that wouldn't happen to me. My body had slipped away from that kind of life, escaped into a safer place. The elements could no longer kill me now. The sun, the tides, the wind, the end-of-year floods \u2013 I was safe from them, but I was also incapable of facing them. I thought of my mother, squatting on the bare earth of our smallholding for hours as she tried to dig out a tree by its roots. Was she older then than I was now? She must have been.\n\n'Anyway,' Jezmine pointed out, 'even if we manage to finish all the smaller jobs, who's going to do the construction work?'\n\nI didn't answer, I just stood looking at the scarred land.\n\n'You're really, truly, going to get sacked,' Jezmine added as she walked back into the office.\n\nWhen I joined her there she was scrolling through some numbers on her computer screen, murmuring the names of people I didn't recognise. 'What are you doing?'\n\n'Trying to find the name of an agency,' she said without looking away from the screen. 'Someone who can supply us with some workers \u2013 fast.'\n\n'Tomorrow?'\n\n'Like, today.'\n\n'If we get new workers, what happens when our guys come back?'\n\nShe shrugged. 'That's your problem.'\n\n'It won't be fair on them.'\n\n'You want me to do this or not?' She turned away from her screen to face me. 'Listen, I can get another job in town by next week if I want to. But you can't. What are you going to do if Mr Lai comes back and finds this mess?'\n\nI nodded and went to make some tea, making sure to wipe the kettle and the work surfaces with a cloth that Jezmine had soaked in bleach. We took care never to touch anything outside without putting on rubber gloves, but we didn't want to take any risks. I heard Jezmine ring one number and speak to someone, and I was surprised, as I always was, by the way her voice changed when she talked to people about work matters, even though I heard it every day. Her pitch dropped, the words slowing down so the other person could hear every syllable clearly, the way a parent talks to an uncooperative child. The sound of the words slowly pinning down the squirming kid. After a few minutes she hung up and rang another number, then another. Every time, there was a problem. No, this week was too soon. No, we don't supply temporary workers. No, we only deal with three-year contracts. No, you have to provide accommodation. No, you must be joking.\n\n'What kind of idiots are you talking to anyway?' I said.\n\nJezmine was spinning a pencil with her fingers, twirling it back and forth around her thumb. She only did this when she was annoyed \u2013 the only sign she ever showed of being flustered. 'Legal ones. Like, they're actually licensed?'\n\n'Licensed my ass. If you go and meet the guy you just spoke to, give him a thousand bucks, he'll sort something out for you.'\n\n'Well I'm not going to break the law.' She sat back in her chair, crossed her arms and looked at me without blinking for a long time. 'What other ideas do you have in your brilliant mind?'\n\nI won't sit here and tell you that I hadn't thought of Keong before that point. Of course I had. I considered ringing him the moment we lost the first man to cholera. I heard his voice in my head, boasting about the deals he'd cut, the tricky situations he'd been able to negotiate. _Anything you want, I can get it for you_. Half of what he said was lies \u2013 I knew that for a fact \u2013 but what about the other half? If he had achieved only 50 per cent of what he claimed, there was a chance he could solve my problems in a heartbeat. Even 30 or 20 per cent would have been fine. But on the other hand, I would have to speak to Keong, eat with him, go to karaoke bars and sing old songs with him. He'd have a reason to call me whenever he liked. He would expect gratitude; I'd have to pretend to be grateful. A 20 per cent chance of truth \u2013 of a solution to that one problem \u2013 measured against the return of someone you wanted to forget; of a life you thought you'd left behind.\n\nThat was the calculation that ran through my head over and over again as I sat looking at Jezmine. Her gaze was like a challenge. Eventually I said, 'I know someone. An old friend.'\n\nShe turned away and began to scroll through the numbers on her screen again. 'I didn't think you even had any friends.'\n\nI looked through my phone for Keong's last text, which I knew lay buried somewhere in my messages from a few weeks before. I hadn't saved his number as a contact in my phone, but I hadn't deleted all his texts either. I don't know why I kept a few of them \u2013 I can't say it was because I had a premonition of some sort, an anticipation of his usefulness. It was nothing like that, nothing logical. I'd simply laughed at the silliness of a couple of them, and thought I might want to look at them again. The coarse tone, the cheerfulness. The swear words he used, which no one else I knew would use in a text. When you hear them on the street their vulgarity seems funny, but written down, they acquire a different weight. They shocked me, but they made me laugh too. If Jenny ever saw them, she would have been disgusted \u2013 not just by the words, but by the mere knowledge that I knew anyone who would write them down. And she'd be right: decent people don't use words like that.\n\nI found the message, and walked out of the office before dialling the number. When I was a safe distance away I turned back and saw that Jezmine was watching me, waiting to see if my conversation was animated or subdued \u2013 to see if I could actually achieve something. I didn't want her to overhear anything I said or to make fun of the way I spoke. I knew my voice and my manner changed when I talked to Keong and others like him, who had no time for pleasantries and didn't respect other people unless they acted the same way. If you wanted something from them you had to be like them. 'You're not very convincing as a hard man,' Jezmine had once teased me after I finished a call to a cement supplier in Kuala Kubu Baru. I didn't want that kind of comment this time; I didn't want to be distracted while talking to Keong. I turned and walked slowly until I was down by the ponds and out of sight of the office. But Keong didn't answer the phone, and my call went through to the automated voicemail. I hung up without leaving a message. Maybe he'd changed phones, maybe that number didn't even belong to him any more \u2013 I couldn't be sure of anything. I redialled quickly; again, no answer.\n\nI stood for a few moments looking at the ponds, the surface of the water ruffled evenly by the jets of water coursing through the pumps. Beyond them, the mouth of the river fringed by small trees that would soon be half-submerged by the tide. And further on, the mouse-grey sea, flat and calm as it often was.\n\nWhat would I do when Mr Lai sacked me the following week? I could slip away before he arrived and saw the extent of the damage, vanish overnight just like migrant workers do. Or I could hang on, try to salvage my position. (But how? Impossible.) I could ask Jezmine to take me along when she went hunting for a new job. That was it, that was the solution. She'd take pity on me, find some way of finding me decent work wherever she found some. She wasn't exaggerating when she said she'd ease swiftly into something new, and probably better. She didn't fear rejection \u2013 not because she was young, but because she knew she could survive in the world. In fact more than survive; she could control what happened in her life. She was good with people \u2013 so good that it surprised me sometimes, hearing her speak on the phone or watching her at meetings. Her ease, her confidence. My astonishment was so sharp that on occasion I experienced it as a sort of wonder that turned into a brief pain.\n\nWe never talked about her family or her childhood, just as we'd always avoided mine, despite the numerous mentions of my being a local boy. But I knew she wasn't so different from me. We understood each other. When she looked at me perhaps she remembered a brother or cousin she had, someone not as quick-witted as she was. It wasn't unusual in families like ours. The older boy wants to pull rank, but never can, because his younger sister or cousin is smarter and braver, and in the end it's the young girl who has to help the boy with his homework and translate his furious adolescent shouting into something their parents can understand and accept. And because she does that she starts to pity him; but her pity also attaches her to him. He is hapless, she is clever; so she has to look after him. I saw that all the time in our village, the bright girls who should have moved away to the city and never come back, but instead chose to stay behind to run the household while their kind, slow brothers fished the empty seas and brought no money home. Pity. That was why Jezmine would help me get work. She felt sorry for me.\n\nI had already worked this out in my mind as I started to walk back to the office, more calmly now. Once you accept the end of a particular time in your life, the past starts to slip away rapidly, even if nothing new appears in its place. Just as I had decided one day that I was going to leave KL, I knew then that my years of working at the farm were over. No drama. I'd ask Jezmine to find me a job, and if she didn't I'd find something on my own, just as I always had. I'd find a way of telling Jenny, but only after I found something new. I wouldn't tell her I'd screwed up and got sacked, I'd say I wanted a change. I'd figured everything out by the time I reached the office \u2013 that was how clear my thinking was, now that I had made my decision. After I left the farm that evening I would never come back to it. I'd leave it to rot.\n\nI'd just walked into the office when my phone rang. I'd replaced it in its pouch, clipped to my belt; its vibrations felt stronger than usual, or maybe it was the heat of the day, rising with the midday sun, or the sudden quiet of the office after the noise of the water pumps outdoors. I'd been so resolute in my decision to move on that it took me a few moments to register that it was Keong ringing. The number flashed on the little square screen, but I didn't instantly recognise it, even though I'd dialled it just a few minutes before.\n\n'Please answer that before it drives me insane,' Jezmine said, looking at a piece of paper as she typed on her keyboard.\n\n' _Hey, little brother!_ ' Keong's voice was even louder than usual. In the background I heard metal clanging and people shouting in a foreign language I couldn't quite make out. Some laughter. Then a sharp grinding noise that briefly drowned out Keong's voice. 'You called me? I'm in a processing plant. The bastards are \u2013'\n\n'What? Where are you?'\n\n'I told you,' he said, shouting now. 'In \u2013'\n\n'Keong,' I said, trying to imitate Jezmine's professional phone voice, 'I rang because I wanted to ask if you could help. I mean \u2013 not me, the farm. My employer has a slight problem. I mean, not a problem, just a... situation.'\n\nJezmine was typing a document, glancing between her papers and the computer screen, but I knew she was listening intently.\n\n'Situation? What the fuck does that mean?' Keong laughed.\n\n'I mean, it's a situation that requires a professional solution.'\n\n'Wait, I can't hear you, hang on.' He walked away from the noise, holding the phone to his ear all the time, so I could hear his breathing, heavy and troubled in the heat. 'Yeah, what's the problem?'\n\nI looked at Jezmine. 'We have a manpower issue.'\n\n' _Manpower issue_. What the fuck you talking about? Manpower issue my ass.'\n\n'We have a labour shortage,' I said. 'The situation is quite, umm, urgent.'\n\n'Your hotshot boss with all his business in Singapore, he doesn't have any friends meh?'\n\nI went outside. 'Keong,' I said, holding the phone tight to my ear and lowering my voice. 'I need you to help me.'\n\nThere was a pause, and when he spoke again his voice had changed, no longer cut with his rough laughter. I heard some rustling, the metal clink of his lighter.\n\n'I need some workers. Fast. Men capable of heavy labour. Construction guys who know what they're doing. A big job. I can pay them a decent wage but I need them quickly. Can you help or not?'\n\nHe exhaled slowly, and I could imagine his face, the way his eyes narrowed as he blew out the cigarette smoke. As if life was hazy and somewhat beautiful. 'Don't worry about salaries, it won't cost you much.'\n\n'So you can help?'\n\nAnother pause, long enough to make me think that I'd misunderstood, or that he was going to change his mind.\n\n'You can always count on me. You have a problem, you can just call Ah Keong. You know that.'\n\n'Sorry to trouble you with this,' I said. I was standing in the middle of the yard, and the sun was so bright I had to shield my eyes, even though I wasn't looking at anything in particular. 'It's just that I'm in a really tricky situation.'\n\n'If you can't rely on your old childhood friends, who can you rely on? We're more or less brothers. We have to help each other out, don't we?'\n\nBack at the office, Jezmine was texting someone. She spoke to me the moment I walked in, but didn't look up. ' _Wah_ , your friend always talks so loudly? You're just on the other end of the phone, he doesn't need to project his voice all the way from the other side of the country for you to hear.'\n\n'Just finish your text. I'll talk to you when you're done.'\n\n'I can do two things at once.'\n\nI tried to deliver the news as casually as possible, as if the outcome had been as predictable as daybreak. 'I'm getting the workers. It's done.'\n\nShe lowered her phone and stared at me. 'You're kidding.'\n\nI smiled and pretended to look through some papers, as if searching for an important piece of information. 'If you don't believe me, that's your problem.'\n\nMy phone pinged, twice, signalling new messages, which I knew even before I looked at them would be from Keong.\n\n_Meet me tomorrow Problem solved_\n\n_Brothers help each other_\n\n##\n\nEvery time we meet I watch her looking through her papers. Some of them are loose, kept neatly in a folder. She also has a ring file where she keeps them in separate sections marked by coloured dividers. Most of the papers are typed sheets, mainly in English and Malay, but there are news clippings too, a lot of them from the Chinese press. She also has many sheets in her own handwriting, and sometimes as I'm talking she'll scribble something down, very quickly in perfectly neat lines, the tip of the pen running lightly over the paper. I could never write like that.\n\nI know that all these papers and notes are about me.\n\nI pretend that I'm not watching her. That I'm not interested in what she's writing. But most of the time, when her head is inclined and she's concentrating on reading or writing, I'm trying to read what is on the papers. I can never make anything out clearly. She's just a bit too far away from me. Whenever we pause for one of us to go the bathroom or the kitchen, she closes her notebooks and files, even if we're only taking a two-minute break. She doesn't want me to see what's inside.\n\n_Wah_ , you've got so many papers. You typed them all yourself? I said one day.\n\nNot so many. It's kinda normal when you do a research project.\n\nWhat's written down in all those notebooks?\n\nOh, just bits and pieces. Wouldn't make sense to anyone but me. It wouldn't be interesting to you.\n\nThis morning she was writing something and drawing diagrams on a large sheet of paper while I talked. I wanted to see what she was doing, but every time I looked my voice faltered and I lost concentration on what I was saying. She'd look up, and I'd have to pretend I wasn't observing her. A research project. I wondered how I would appear in her project, whether I would be a nicer version of myself. Or a worse one.\n\nJust before midday, she looks at her phone. So sorry, she says. I really hate to do this, but I really have to call my mother. She's got a hospital appointment later today and I have to make some arrangements. I won't be long.\n\nShe goes to the kitchen and disappears from view, but I can hear her conversation. I wait for a few moments before reaching across for the notebook closest to me. I open it without hesitating and begin to read.\n\n##\n\n_December 12th_\n\nKeong was waiting for me just off the Meru highway, at exactly the spot he'd described \u2013 a layby in front of a small row of shops. He was sitting in his car with the door open, smoking a cigarette and eating, dipping his hand into a large packet of prawn snacks that he'd set on the dashboard. I saw him from the other side of the road, while I was at the junction waiting to make a U-turn \u2013 one foot hanging out of the car, tapping on the grassy kerb, lifting his chin to blow out smoke the way people did in all those Hong Kong gangster movies we used to watch back in the nineties. There was a slowness to his movements, an impression of leisure, as if he could have hung around on that dusty stretch of road for hours, the way teenagers do. He got out of the car when he saw me pulling into the space in front of him, flicked his cigarette into the dirt, emptied the remains of the packet of prawn crackers into his hand and shoved them into his mouth.\n\n'You shouldn't eat that rubbish,' I said.\n\n'I don't care, my body's already fucked.' He wiped his hands on his jeans and opened the passenger door of my car. 'We're going to take your car. My air-con doesn't work.'\n\nWe drove northwards, then cut inland into the heart of the plantations, where the roads were long and narrow and straight, and mostly empty, except for the lorries that carried the loads of palm-oil seeds to the factories for processing. On either side of the road the view was the same, the palm trees deepening into a shade so dense and resolute that it seemed to last infinitely, as if on the other side lay not just the east\u2013west highway or Pahang, but Russia or Alaska, or the seventh ring of Saturn. Once a contractor who came to the farm showed us maps of the area, and some photos taken from a helicopter. Away from the sea and the narrow, irregular strip of human habitation along the coast there was nothing but a flawless, flat green carpet of plantations stretching as far as you could see, with not even the smallest patch of forest to break up the uniformity of the land. Plantation after plantation, each one the size of Singapore, or Luxembourg. 'Actually, Luxembourg is much bigger than Singapore,' Jezmine had said. 'I think you mean Liechtenstein. Or Andorra. Someplace like that.' I never figured out how she knew such things.\n\n'This whole damn area all looks the same to me,' Keong said. 'Gives me the creeps. If you wanted to kill someone all you'd need to do is send him for a walk in there, tell him there's a shack that sells stolen brandy or something. Poor fucker would walk around in circles for days before dying. Fuck. That's why I always hated living here. Messes my head up.'\n\nHe was right, in a way, and that was why he needed me with him. If you wanted to find your way around without driving in a huge loop you had to know how to read the differences in the landscape \u2013 the way the palm trees were of a slightly different age and height, how some estates were older or newer, the way the roads faced the sun in varying ways, the villages that were each different, or maybe the small _surau_ or Hindu temple that lay obscured by the trees \u2013 a tiny landmark that you could easily drive past unless you knew it was there. All these things told you how far you'd gone, whether you'd taken a wrong turn somewhere, how much time you had left to your destination. This was before GPS, remember \u2013 or maybe it already existed, but only very rich people could afford to have it in their cars. Nowadays even my neighbours round here look at their phones just to drive into the city or other places they've been to a hundred times. _It's because the roads change so fast_ , they say, but that's not the reason. It's because _we_ change so fast. No one wants to risk getting lost any more. No one has any time to lose. But I'm sure that out there, not so many miles away, when you're on those small roads, your phone won't be able to tell you the way. Don't think Google cares about Sabak Bernam or Kuala Selangor.\n\n'You really have to be a local to know your way round these parts,' Keong said. 'Thank goodness you're here. I'd have driven halfway to Taiping by now.'\n\nWe were looking for an estate whose name meant something to me. I had a feeling I'd driven past it a couple of times a number of years ago, when Mr Lai and I had to take a few trips up that way to buy some cheap weedkiller and netting, in the days when we were just getting started and no one would deliver goods to us because we didn't order enough. He would cut the deals himself with an old man to whom he spoke Hakka to get a good price \u2013 he couldn't really speak the dialect, but he'd learned enough from his mother to be able to make decent connections when he needed to. He couldn't even afford to hire a foreign worker back then, so I would go along to load the small lorry we owned, carrying the sacks to the edge of the open platform at the back before climbing up onto it and hauling everything into place. I'm talking fifteen years ago at least, more maybe, and I was stronger then. _Wah, you're really made for this!_ Mr Lai would say as he watched me pack the goods tightly onto the back of the lorry, and he wasn't wrong: my body took easily to that kind of work, whether due to the genes I inherited from my parents or to the years I spent working on the farm. But nothing ever remains the same, not even a labourer's genes. Only a few years later I would lose the ability to work like that. I got married, got promoted, my body forgot what it was like to toil in the sun and rain. But on those long slow drives back to the farm, cutting through the plantations and stretches of forest, the small bridges that wriggled their way across the flat land, I didn't question my body, and my body didn't question what I asked of it. I used to hang an arm out of the window, holding the steering wheel with one hand, never wondering what would happen to me in later years \u2013 never believing that I would ever be anything other than twenty-three years old.\n\nAt that point in my life everything seemed new and slightly wondrous to me. My years of stop-start work in dead-end jobs in KL had come to an end, I'd had steady employment for over a year, and more lay ahead of me. I remembered every detail of those days \u2013 Mr Lai falling asleep in the passenger seat with his mouth open, a trail of saliva tracing its way down the side of his cheek. The clutch that stuck and screeched loudly every time I changed from second to third. The way the leaves of the palm trees turned silver-grey rather than green in the lowering sun late in the afternoon. The broken-down _attap_ huts set back from the road, whose dried-foliage roofs had blown away in the previous year's storms \u2013 things that had always been in my life, so constant that they became invisible by their permanence. They came into focus then, just for those few months \u2013 or years, I can't remember exactly \u2013 before they faded away again.\n\nThat was how I knew the name 'Golden Land', the general location of the plantation, the quickest way to get there. 'You sure you know?' Keong said as we drove along slowly, stuck behind a lorry that held up the traffic. 'When was the last time you went there?'\n\nI shrugged. 'Before you were born, so just shut up.'\n\nHe laughed and leaned his head back, as if he was going to sleep, but he kept talking, continuously and without need for any response from me. He had a really rough time when he lived down in these parts, he said. When he lived in the village. Everyone hated him. Even his mother disliked him \u2013 she disliked him for being disliked. Why can't you get along with people? she used to say. Why can't you be friendlier to people? We're outsiders, we come to this place, we have to behave properly or no one will accept us. Be gentle in your manner. Be polite. If the other boys insult you, just walk away. If they beat you, just run away. What the fuck. Single mother with a teenage son, you think she was ever going to be accepted? All that time spent cooking and sewing for other people in the village, cleaning their houses, often not even getting paid \u2013 it made no difference, they still looked down on her. Imagine, people in a shithole like that, looking down on her. Sometimes he used to fantasise about going around the village at night dousing all the houses with petrol when everyone was asleep, then setting the whole damn place on fire. Of course he never did. Petrol was too expensive! Anyway, too late to regret that now. He didn't fit in, and that was the end of it. Thank God I was there. I, Lee Hock Lye \u2013 _Jayden_ Lee Hock Lye, _wahlau_! \u2013 was the one who kept him sane. And yet his mother had told him, more than once, not to hang out with me. She liked me, but didn't want him spending time with me.\n\n'Why?'\n\n'Because your family was too much like ours. A broken home.'\n\n'But she made dumplings for me. Steamed buns. Biscuits.'\n\n'Don't ask me,' he replied, easing a cigarette out from its pack. He paused for a moment before lowering the window. The air that rushed around the car muffled his voice and I struggled to hear him. 'I guess if you want to be respected, you have to hang out with people who are respectable. Rich ones. _Normal_ ones. You don't want to be associated with \u2013'\n\nA lorry went past, travelling in the opposite direction, drowning out what Keong was saying. I wasn't interested in what he and his mother thought of us. _We were normal_ , I thought. In that village, at least, we never stood out. I chose not to argue with him, I just let him carry on. It didn't matter anyway, it was such a long time in the past; it had no bearing on the life I had now, no bearing on my future.\n\nWe were passing a convoy of lorries, strung out over a few miles \u2013 it must have been a time for harvesting the palm-oil seeds, because the trucks were heavy with the orange-brown fruit. The rumble of their engines as we passed them made it difficult for me to hear Keong clearly, and I was glad for this. I picked up the word _sorry_ once, and perhaps a second time, and when we broke clear of the lorries I understood that he was apologising for having left KL so abruptly when we lived there as young men. Remember the friend of his that he used to mention, the one who was going to work in a hotel in Hong Kong? ( _No, in fact I didn't remember_.) He'd been asking Keong to go and join him over there. The salary was great, they'd rent a room together in Mongkok or somewhere further up in the New Territories, and they'd save up enough money to go back home in a few years' time and set up their own business, a restaurant or something like that. In hindsight it was a stupid move, but when you're young and in his position, even vague promises sound like concrete career plans.\n\nHe'd been having a lot of problems at the time. ( _Yes, I remembered that_.) His head was muddled, he couldn't think straight. He'd started taking some of the pills he'd been selling, and they screwed with his brains, exhausted him. ( _I suspected, oh I suspected, but I never knew for sure_.) One week he would imagine living in a penthouse on the Peak in Hong Kong, the next week he saw himself lying down on the tarmac and dying in the middle of Chow Kit market. He'd stay awake for two, three nights in a row, then sleep for two or three days afterwards. He had no money, he was always in danger of getting into trouble \u2013 with the police, with the gangsters who hung around the same places he did. That's why he woke up one day and thought, I have to leave. Now.\n\nHe used all his money to buy a cheap ticket to Hong Kong, but we all know how that story ends \u2013 right there, where it began. He landed in Hong Kong with his friend, but after two unsuccessful weeks of looking for a job, he had to come home. No one would take someone like him \u2013 no papers and no qualifications. Not even low-grade shops like those selling herbal remedies or school uniforms would accept him. He could have got a job washing dishes in a cheap restaurant, like his friend did, but if he wanted that sort of work, might as well do it at home. He still remembered the feeling he'd had, sitting in the departure lounge at the airport in Hong Kong and hearing that his flight home had been delayed. He'd thought that if he didn't get on that plane within the next ten minutes, he was going to explode, he was going to smash the whole goddamn place to pieces, he was going beat the hell out of whoever was making those announcements telling him he had to wait, longer and longer and longer, before he could go home. For the first time since he'd been a small child, he thought he was going to cry. The thought of returning to where he belonged made him tearful and weak, and he didn't know if it was out of shame or relief. Then he did cry.\n\nWhen he got back he thought of calling me, but didn't, because he was embarrassed. What would he tell me? That he had gone away and failed? After just two weeks? He couldn't do that. He knew I'd be upset with him for just disappearing on me ( _I hadn't been angry, I'd thought: I'm glad_ ); he couldn't think of a way to explain why he'd been such an unreliable friend.\n\nThe experience sobered him up. On coming home, he started that course in computing that he'd always said he'd take, and it enabled him to get a job at a construction firm. That was when he started noticing the number of foreign workers in the country. Everywhere. One day he'd seen a team of men of all sorts of foreign nationalities fixing the wiring in the ceiling of an office block that was about to be completed. From a distance the men looked as if they were holding up the concrete above their heads, and Keong had thought: Without them, the whole damn building would collapse. In fact, take these workers away and the entire country would crumble. That was when he realised how much money there was to be made in bringing in workers from abroad. It didn't take him long to find a job with a small company that did just that.\n\nBut he had felt bad. All those years, he'd wished he'd said a proper goodbye to me.\n\n'Forget it,' I said. 'I didn't really care.'\n\nHe kept talking, and with the noise of the wind swirling through the open windows it took me a few moments to realise that he had moved on to another subject, changing his focus without warning, the way he always had. He was telling me about Bangladeshis. Did I know that the average Malaysian earned ten, fifteen times what the average Bangladeshi earned? That's why there were so many of them here. If a Bangladeshi worker went to Singapore, he'd earn fifty times what he'd earn back home. Fifty times! Anyone would get in a boat and take some beatings if they thought they were going to earn that much money. But mostly they end up here, because in Singapore there are rules, permits, all that nonsense you can't change. Try and bribe someone, you go straight to jail. No permit, no talk. But here it's different. They can get in all sorts of different ways. There are people out there who help them enter the country, and once they're here they can go to the mosque, eat _halal_ food \u2013 it's easier for them, so they settle for less pay.\n\nWe were on our way to find a group of them, Keong explained, some Bangladeshis who had recently arrived in the country. Eighteen of them, mostly men, though he wasn't sure. With Bangladeshis it was rare to find any women in the group \u2013 unlike the shipments from Myanmar, where you'd often find women.\n\n_The shipments_. He used the word in the way Mr Lai did when he talked about lorryloads of frozen fish travelling to the city, or the ground soy and corn that we used as feed. But when I glanced across at Keong I saw that he hadn't noticed how strange the word sounded. He hadn't meant anything unusual by it \u2013 a shipment was a shipment to him. It was just work.\n\nThese workers hadn't yet been placed in a job, he explained, and were waiting to be assigned to their first contract, which Keong had lined up somewhere close by. That job wouldn't be starting for another month, so he could lend them to me for two, three weeks \u2013 long enough to finish the construction work at the farm and save me from getting sacked. Then, if I thought the men worked well, he could fix it so that they stayed on the farm for the rest of their time in the country. Three years at least, and easily double that if I wanted.\n\n'I don't need them for that long. Just enough for my men to take a break and recover from their illness.'\n\n'What do you pay your Indonesians?'\n\nI told him.\n\n'You'd save 25, 30 per cent every month if you take my guys. Bangladeshis are so much cheaper. Think about it \u2013 your boss will build a whole fucking temple at your grandparents' grave when he learns how much money you're going to save him.'\n\n'I can't.'\n\n'Huh? Why not?'\n\n'What would I do with my guys when they recover from their illness?'\n\n'Sack them, _lor_.' He laughed, and started whistling a tune \u2013 the chorus to an old Anita Mui number that was so off-key I couldn't recognise it at first. Then, as if remembering something, he said, 'In fact, they've already sacked themselves. Put it this way. In any of those lousy jobs we worked at when we were younger, what would have happened if you fell sick and didn't turn up to work for a week?'\n\n'I never fell sick.'\n\n'But if you had, by the time you went back to work, your boss would have found someone new. What else would you expect them to do? You get sick, you get the sack.'\n\nWe were entering the area of the plantation, the trees on either side of the road lined up in perfect straight rows \u2013 taller now, obscuring the rise and fall of the land in the distance. Where was the low hill I remembered, with a telephone mast or electric pylon on it, a metal pillar of some sort? I started to wonder if my memory was as reliable as I'd thought, but then we saw a sign that announced the plantation. Keong said, 'OK, now we have to find the north-eastern boundary. That's where your men will be.' He leaned forward and looked up at the sky, as if he could figure out our position relative to that of the sun \u2013 a feat that both of us knew he was incapable of. 'Turn left at the next junction, probably.'\n\n'No, we turn right.' I drove faster. I wanted to get there quickly, sort this mess out as soon as I could. I knew roughly how big the plantation was, and I worked out how long it would take us to get to our destination \u2013 only another ten minutes at most if I hurried. I'd worked out, too, what I'd do with Keong's men. I'd keep them for a couple of weeks, max, maybe just one week or ten days, then I'd send them back to him, make an excuse that both of us would recognise as a weak pretext; but out of respect for an old friendship we'd pretend it was fine, and Keong would place them somewhere else, and I would never see them, or him, again. In the days they were with me, they'd accomplish little, but it would be enough for Mr Lai to see them at work \u2013 proof of my reliability and ingenuity. There would be no time for either party to form any attachments, for them or for me. The farm would be just another place of work to them, as familiar and alien as any other they'd worked at before. I knew that feeling from my younger days \u2013 remembered how it was to work somewhere just to survive. They would make sure they didn't rely on the farm to provide them with anything more than a few days' wages; they'd know it could end at any time. And so, when Hendro and the others came back, I'd simply call Keong and have the Bangladeshis sent away. There would be no drama in the whole affair.\n\nI slowed as we approached the end of the estate, where the trees thinned out, allowing the sun to spread across the land and reflect on the surface of the marshy fields nearby. Keong checked a message on his phone. 'This is the right place,' he said. We cut our speed until we were going so slowly that we could see even the ripples in the pools of rainwater that had collected in the open ground, shrinking now in the midday sun. The plantation was behind us now, the landscape becoming ragged and untamed, with long grass and scrubby bushes before it ran into the next plantation, about half a mile ahead. When we reached it we doubled back, searching for signs of human dwellings, but there was no one around. We stopped the car and got out \u2013 still nothing. I began to wonder if Keong had made up the whole story, as I knew he'd fabricated things in the past. Bad shit that people had done to him. Fictitious enemies. Beautiful coincidences that he'd experienced. Places he'd visited. Nothing was beyond his imagination.\n\nHe checked his phone again, and made a call. 'Fuck. No signal. Damn this place!'\n\n'What the hell are you playing at?' I shouted. The words sounded sharper than I'd expected, or maybe it was just the sudden noise in the midst of all that silence. In the full heat of the day there was no sound \u2013 not even the rushing of the wind that accompanied the changing of the tides, or the noisy jungle insects anticipating nightfall. 'I should've known better than to trust a loser like you with something important.'\n\n'Fuck you,' Keong said as we got back in the car and I started to retrace our route. He kept pressing buttons on his phone, but the signal was too weak. 'That guy who gave me the information, I'm going to beat him to death, I'm going to chop him to pieces.' He repeated this a few times, but I wasn't listening to anything he said. _Hallo, hallo!_ He shouted into his phone, but the line wouldn't connect.\n\n'Wait,' I said. The sudden braking of the car startled Keong, and he fell silent abruptly. 'Look there.' I pointed to a spot in the distance, where the neat line of the plantation palms gave way to a messy tangle of shrubs and young trees. Keong lifted his sunglasses and squinted. ' _There_ ,' I said, but he still couldn't see. A sheet of grey canvas, hanging from a tree trunk. Nearby, what appeared to be empty raffia sacks on the ground, dirty white mostly, though I thought I could make out a tiny patch of red.\n\n'What the fuck you looking at?'\n\nI got out of the car and began to pick my way through the long scratchy grass, heading towards those old bits of cloth that hung unmoving in the shade of the trees. It wasn't easy to make out exactly what they were, and at times, with the sun in my eyes, I thought they looked like carcasses, pieces of dead animals. When I was a child, I woke up one day to find the villagers agitated. Someone had lost a dog, one of those small thin mongrels that spent all day on the streets, and at night wandered around in packs that drifted into the forests to play or to hunt small animals or God knows what. The owner of this particular dog eventually found it dead, halfway up a tree, half eaten by a black panther. The other kids and I ran over to see its remains, but all we could see was a grey-white piece of skin dangling overhead. Any blood or flesh had turned black, and we couldn't make out its face, or anything that identified it as the creature we once knew. We were frightened not by the death, or the savagery of the killing \u2013 we grew up by the sea, don't forget, we'd seen worse \u2013 but by how easily a life could be scrubbed out without trace. Without any mourning, or sadness, or even realisation that it was now over. _It looks like a dirty dress_ , one of the kids said as we walked away. We laughed, but we couldn't stop thinking about the dog, and how it was now just a scrap of cloth.\n\nIt was that same feeling of dread that I experienced as I walked towards those pieces of canvas snagged in the branches ahead of me. _A dirty dress_. I tried to avoid the patches of ground that were soggy, but it wasn't easy. Sometimes I'd step firmly onto what looked like a mound of grass only for it to give way to a pool of brown rainwater. Behind me, Keong was cursing loudly. Where was I going, what the hell did I want to see, why did he even agree to help me. He started running, splashing through puddles and cursing even more violently, and by the time I reached the thicket he had almost caught up with me.\n\nWe stood for a while and stared at the canvas tarpaulin. Close-up, we could see pieces of string hanging from its edges, clearly showing where it had been attached to other tree trunks, stretching it to make a shelter that seemed too low for an adult to stand up under, though maybe that was the point of it. String up a length of canvas at ceiling height and it's obvious that it's meant to shelter human beings. String it up two or three feet lower, below the line of the bushes, and no one notices it. The undergrowth had been cleared away, and the space was littered with plastic bags and wrappers, flattened by the rain into the ground and the foliage, but not yet bleached of their colour \u2013 they couldn't have been there for more than a few days. Further away was a large mound of burnt sticks. When I nudged it with my foot, a layer of powdery white ash came loose at its base.\n\n'This is where they were,' I said. 'They've only moved recently.'\n\nKeong walked around the small clearing, kicking at bits of rubbish on the ground. _Bastard bastard bastard_ , he repeated. _Cheating lying bastard_.\n\n'Guess you were right,' I said.\n\n'I'm going to mess that guy up so much.' Keong was already making his way back to the car. 'He's going to regret ever double-crossing me.'\n\n'Who?'\n\n'The guy I mentioned,' he said. ' _That black devil._ '\n\nBack at the car we took off our shoes and wet socks. I tried to wring them dry but the swampy water had got into them and made them smell bad, so I tossed them into the grass. Keong laid his on the roof of the car, hoping they'd dry in the fierce sun, but it was useless, and eventually he threw them away too. I drove barefoot, the pedals hard and gritty on my toes. Keong was silent, and I drove fast, surprising myself by how easily I slipped from one road into the next, always finding the smoothest route. As we got closer to town I said, 'I guess we can forget about getting any workers for the farm.' The moment I said it I regretted it, and expected Keong's silence to erupt into another tantrum. But he remained quiet, and just stared straight ahead into the afternoon light that slanted directly into our eyes.\n\n'I'll get them for you,' he said. 'But you have to help me. We need to find the guy who's taken them.'\n\n##\n\nWhat strikes me are the lists. There are lists of everything. Often the most boring everyday details. Like:\n\n*\n\nHome d\u00e9cor: (use details in introduction??)\n\nCalendar (Mei Fung Confectionery) from 2014. (November: pic of Guilin cliffs)\n\nChinese New Year scrolls, faded.

I know that's not the way it works, I know that science wouldn't back up that view, but that's how it felt. There was a disease upon us, and it wasn't going to lift.\n\nI met Keong at the same layby as the last time, and as I drew up I thought about how swiftly habits formed. See you at the usual place, he'd texted the night before, and it was true \u2013 on just the second occasion this spot felt as if it occupied a particular position in our lives, a fixed point that linked us. I saw the tip of his cigarette glow in the early-morning gloom \u2013 it was not long after 6 a.m., and the grass was still damp with dew. 'Motherfucker,' he said, yawning. 'Why am I up so early? I must be mad.'\n\n'Just a usual working day for me,' I replied. 'You want some coffee?'\n\n'I don't need coffee, I need drugs.' He stretched and let out a sharp, barking groan, as if the movement had caused him pain. 'Just kidding. Come on, we're taking your car.'\n\nWe drove to a new housing development in the middle of a huge stretch of scrubland not far from the highway, before the roads narrowed and led into the heart of the plantations. The houses were almost finished, rows and rows of simple two-storeys with green-tiled roofs and neat front yards \u2013 nothing special, you know the kind, you see them everywhere \u2013 but workers were still installing the windows and doors. 'Who the hell would want to live here?' I said. 'We're miles from town.' The road hadn't yet been surfaced, and the dust we raised was like a gauze that made the workers look like phantoms \u2013 figures emerging from a dream.\n\n'There's no more space in town,' Keong said. 'These houses are cheap as dirt. Come back in a couple of years and I bet you'll find a huge mall here, with cinema and bowling alley.'\n\nHe held up his hand, signalling for me to slow down as we reached a crossroads. Up ahead, a group of workers were lowering a length of pipe into a trench. Keong got out of the car and walked towards them, barking an indistinct word that made them look up. One of them straightened up and wiped his hands on his trousers, as if cleaning them in preparation for a handshake, but in the end he just wiped the sweat from his face. Keong stood with his hands on his hips, watching the men as they started shovelling mounds of earth into the trench. That was when I noticed their movements \u2013 laboured and heavy even when performing the simplest action, like sticking a shovel into a pile of earth \u2013 the red clay that seemed to become as unyielding as stone before them. Every gesture was slow, a split second's hesitation between the start of the movement and its completion, as if they were considering whether they had the strength to complete what they had started. One man bent his knees and looked down into the hole. A pause. Then he _tumbled_ in \u2013 an accidental fall rather than a deliberate motion. It took the help of two of the others to get him out of the pit.\n\nI felt a twinge in my knee joints, and then in my shoulders. The memory of work. My body was recalling its years of hard physical labour, as it did from time to time when I watched workers toiling over a job. Even now, I can be having noodles at a street stall, and if I see someone lifting sacks of concrete, or taking a pickaxe to some cement, my arms and legs want to perform the same actions, even though I know they would be incapable of carrying them out. Still. I read somewhere recently about a former soccer player who kept waking up on the floor because his body was taking free kicks or something like that in the middle of the night, and the action was so violent and real that it lifted him clean off the bed. Fifty years old, covered with bruises. He never even dreamed about soccer, no longer had any interest in it. Our bodies \u2013 every fibre of every muscle, every tiny nerve \u2013 they remember what our minds forget.\n\nWhen you work in the sun at jobs like that, your only thought is to complete them as soon as possible so you can have some rest in the shade, even if it's only five minutes. Even if it's to move on to the next job. And the next. You don't think about how well you're doing; you don't have to. Someone is giving you orders, so you just obey. Your body obeys what you tell it. Your movements are swift, instinctive. Harsh, even. They are harsh because what you are engaged in is a battle \u2013 a battle to finish the job before it finishes you, a battle to gain those five, maybe ten minutes in the shade. A battle for time. There was none of that in that group of men, nor in any of the others we saw later that day. They didn't have the strength to fight.\n\n'Are they sick?' I asked Keong as he got back into the car.\n\n'No,' he replied. 'Nothing's wrong with them. Apart from being lazy bastards.' He pulled down the sun visor so he could see the mirror, then brushed the dust from his hair and smoothed it down.\n\nThey were his men, he explained, meaning that they were working under contracts provided by him. That was how it worked, usually. A property firm or a plantation or a hotel \u2013 whatever it is \u2013 needs manpower, usually in a hurry. They can't go out and find thirty Bangladeshi or Nepalese or Myanmar workers themselves, so they call Keong's company, who have a bunch of people on standby. The employer pays the salaries, Keong takes a cut. The men we saw had been due to complete their work on that site nearly a month earlier, but one thing after another had got in the way, and they were still on that stupid housing estate, with no end in sight. Keong had hoped that their job would have been almost done by now, and that he could steal a few of them away to work for me, but that was impossible.\n\n'The clients are a big-time developer, a listed company,' Keong said. 'I can't mess with them.'\n\n'Are you sure there's nothing wrong with those guys? They really look sick.'\n\n'They're all like that,' he replied.\n\nWe visited a sheet-metal factory, then a processing plant in the middle of a palm-oil plantation, then another construction site \u2013 a row of small commercial units marooned on the edge of ricefields. Then another plantation, where thirty or forty workers, Bangladeshi and Indonesian, were returning to their quarters \u2013 a low concrete block with a rusty tin roof; I couldn't see what was inside. It was nearing the end of the day, and the light was beginning to lose its brilliance, turning rich and orange above the trees. I saw the same lethargy I'd witnessed in each group of foreign workers we'd visited that day, a heaviness beyond the normal boundaries of fatigue, to the point that even breathing seemed an effort to them. Some of them stood outside, splashing themselves with water that they gathered in their cupped hands from a tap. It seemed such a feeble action, incapable of relieving the heat or cleansing their bodies of sweat. The meagre handfuls of water trickled down their torsos and stained their trousers with dark flecks, and they looked no fresher afterwards.\n\nBy this point I knew it wasn't my imagination. All day, I'd watched closely, stood close enough to the workers to see their red glassy eyes and hear their rough breathing, as if their throats were coated with a film of fine sand. At the processing plant there had been a few women \u2013 Burmese, I think, though I couldn't be certain \u2013 working the machinery and organising the loading of the lorries, and at first I thought, I hoped, that they were somehow immune to the weakness of the men I'd seen, that they were more resistant. But they weren't. It was as if they had all given up and succumbed to this malady. There was a sickness in the air. In the land, the water. Everywhere.\n\n'You're crazy,' Keong said when I told him my theory. 'You're desperate and panicking. Your brain is _deep_ _fried_.'\n\nWe stood in the yard of the workers' quarters and watched them queue to fill plastic bottles from the tap. They sat down on the cement, sipping from the bottles without talking much. Out here, the water must come from a well, I thought. I wondered how much of the chemicals and the germs in the earth and the rivers around us had worked their way into it. I thought of our farm, our workers \u2013 I'd had no news of them for nearly two days.\n\nKeong was talking to the foreman, who was himself from Bangladesh. From the way Keong stood, with his hands on his hips, head slightly bowed, I knew what the man was telling him. It had been the same story all day long. There were no spare workers \u2013 man, woman or child. They were all taken. And as for the ones who had disappeared, there was no clue either. 'Guess I should be happy that the global economy is booming,' Keong had said earlier. His lips curled into a smile, but he didn't laugh. Now, talking to the foreman, he seemed resigned to the silent, dead-end situation.\n\n'This group of people are from the same province in Bangladesh as the ones who disappeared,' Keong said. 'I thought they might have heard something, been in touch with them.'\n\nI started walking back to the car. 'What made you think they might know anything?'\n\n'They'll have friends among them, maybe someone from their home village, maybe even a relative \u2013 someone will know something. They might even have been in touch. These people arrive, first thing they do is lay their hands on a phone.'\n\n'I have to go home now,' I said.\n\n'There's one more person we need to talk to,' Keong said. 'Please.'\n\n'Time's up, big brother.' I started the car and eased it out of the yard. The sky was darkening slowly now, dotted with quick-flying bats.\n\n'Ah Hock,' Keong said, 'I can sort this out. Those missing workers are out there. Some bastard is hiding them, and we have to find them.'\n\n'My wife will be home. I have to go.'\n\n'Just one drink,' he said. 'It's important.'\n\nIn the bar of the Tokyo Hotel, which was also the lobby \u2013 since it wasn't, and still isn't, a big or elegant place \u2013 there was the usual mix of travelling salesmen, a couple of Korean businessmen and a small group of tourists from mainland China, their heavy northern accents audible from the other side of the room, cutting through all the noise in the lobby, which on that night felt like a sealed box to me. Maybe it was the hard, polished floor, that kind of shiny fake-marble that you see in fancy places, or at least places that wish they were fancy, or maybe it was the long day out in the countryside, with little noise apart from the monotone of Keong's voice and the wind rushing in through the lowered windows whenever he smoked a cigarette. Whatever the reason, the noise seemed amplified beyond what humankind could naturally produce. The little _ping_ of the lift doors as they opened startled me with its brightness, the ringing of the phone at the reception desk was as shrill as a fire alarm. I needed to open all the windows, I thought \u2013 that would make the sounds feel normal and real once more. Or maybe I was falling ill, my body being claimed by the same sickness I'd witnessed earlier, out there in the countryside.\n\n'Who the hell would want to travel across Asia and do business in a shithole like this?' Keong said, pointing at the Korean businessmen. He'd been silent for the final stretch of the drive, except to give me directions on how to reach the hotel, and now, slumped into an armchair, he seemed as drained of energy as I was. _A shithole like this_. I didn't know if he meant the hotel, or the town, or the whole goddamn country, but I didn't ask. I reached for my beer, which was turning warm, and after just one sip I put it down \u2013 it tasted bitter and unappealing, and I watched the beads of condensation collect on the glass and slowly drip down to the table, where they formed a little puddle.\n\nA Filipina singer \u2013 announced on a poster in the lobby as _The One and Only Sarita_ \u2013 was setting up her act for the evening with her accompanist, a young man wearing a tuxedo about three sizes too big for him, testing the sound system by playing short little melodies on the keyboard. A long screech from the speakers as he adjusted them, followed by a low growl that seemed to be made by a primeval beast, like the roar in a horror movie when the unknown monster makes its appearance. I covered my ears. _Testing, one, two_ , the singer said into the microphone when the speakers had settled. _Hello everyone, now is this working?_ More whining, this time from the mike. _Sorryyy._\n\n'Where the hell is he?' Keong said, looking around. He dialled a number on his phone and held it to his ear. He took a long gulp of his beer, tilting his head backwards. I watched his Adam's apple move in his throat \u2013 a small lump that seemed unnaturally hard and jagged, rolling back and forth as if it was a living thing. Its liveliness disgusted me.\n\nMy throat was dry from thirst and dust after our long day. I wanted some water, but lacked the energy to put my hand up and catch the attention of a waiter. In any case, there was no one around \u2013 the man running the bar, who had brought our drinks earlier, was now doubling up as a receptionist on the front desk. For a few minutes my vision began to tremble, to feel unreliable, as if I couldn't judge how far away people were, or how quickly they moved across the room, or what each human action was intended to do. That man over there, leaning forward in his chair to get closer to his female companion \u2013 was he about to strike her, or speak to her? The hotel manager, hurrying towards the exit \u2013 running to pursue someone, or to escape something? I was dehydrated, I told myself. I wasn't falling sick, I was just dehydrated. I should have drunk some more of my beer, but the thought of it revolted me.\n\nThe singer and the keyboard player returned to the stage to begin their act. The One and Only Sarita was saying something, but the mike was too close to her mouth and I couldn't make out the words, only the sense of energy that she communicated, which made me feel even more tired. She started singing \u2013 'Hero', by Mariah Carey. My head was spinning. I couldn't figure anything out. She clutched her hand and raised it slightly, letting it float upwards, away from her body \u2013 what did that mean? I looked over at Keong. He was mumbling the words, or at least what he thought were the words, but which came out in a low, off-key string of sound that didn't match the singer's timing.\n\nA man emerged from a door in the far corner of the room, behind the bar, dressed in black trousers and a white shirt with a bow tie. A waiter. I put up my hand, but he didn't see me. I should have, could have, simply stood up, but my legs felt as uncertain and unreliable as the rest of me, so I remained in my seat, waving at him. Keong looked up. 'There he is, the bastard.' He put his hand on my arm to stop me from waving. Without knowing why, I let my hand fall. I'm thirsty, I wanted to say. I need some water. I need to go home.\n\nThe waiter walked slowly towards us, and just as with the other people, I was unable to figure out his intentions. He looked around \u2013 nervously, it seemed to me, but why?\n\n'Water,' I said when he arrived at our table. 'I need to drink something.' He wore a badge that displayed his name \u2013 Uzzal.\n\n'You didn't answer your phone,' Keong said, glancing at him briefly, and speaking as if addressing someone else. 'I need help.'\n\nUzzal spoke softly, in Malay that was heavy with a foreign accent \u2013 Bangladeshi, I guessed \u2013 but fluent, or at least fluent enough to make it clear that he'd been in the country for a long time. He was at work, he said. How could he answer his phone while he was at work? He would meet us in a couple of hours, when the last of the customers had gone and he could close the bar. He looked at Keong and said, 'You shouldn't come here next time.'\n\n'We were thirsty,' Keong replied. 'We wanted a drink.'\n\n'I'll bring you something,' Uzzal said. 'But you'll have to pay, otherwise my boss will be suspicious.'\n\nKeong shrugged.\n\nSarita was singing 'I Will Always Love You', and Keong seemed less tired now. The beer had made his cheeks go slightly red, and his eyes moist, which gave him the look of someone who'd just emerged from a hot shower, quietly revived. Uzzal came back a few minutes later with another Carlsberg for Keong and a bottle of water for me. Although I'm now sure I couldn't have done so, in my memory I drank it in one long gulp. I can't remember ever having been as thirsty as I was in the Tokyo Hotel that night \u2013 not before or after.\n\nUzzal was Keong's fixer in Klang. A fixer's fixer. Someone with his ear to the ground. A foreign worker who'd made good. Keong didn't know how long exactly he'd been in the country, but it must have been at least eight or ten years, possibly more. Keong had met him while Uzzal was working at a cement factory in the area \u2013 just another foreign worker, one of a team of fifteen, twenty. But this one guy stood out because of his clothes, which always looked laundered and pressed, and gave the impression that he was different from the others, when in fact he was just the same. He was the only one of the lot who smiled, enough to make people think he was happy doing his job, so of course he got promoted, and every time Keong came back to the factory to check up on the workforce, he noticed Uzzal wearing sharp clothes, organising the people under him as if he'd been doing it all his life. It was strange, Keong had thought: he behaved as both their commander and their comrade. Which is to say, he was one of them, but also not one of them.\n\n'Put it this way,' Keong said. 'Are you friends with the Indonesians who work for you at the fish farm?'\n\n'We get along.'\n\n'But are you friends? Do you take your lunch with them, exchange stories about your wives and kids \u2013 that sort of shit?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'See? They don't really like you. Whenever you have a boss, you have an enemy. But not with this guy.'\n\nWatching Uzzal at work, Keong had realised that he was good with his fellow workers, he could get them to do things that the bosses couldn't \u2013 he never threatened them, but coaxed them. He joked with them. Delivered stern warnings quietly, out of earshot of the others. _This guy is smart, I can use him some day_ , Keong thought. He knew that Uzzal would soon find a way to get himself the right papers and a regular job. Sometimes you'd get that feeling with a migrant. You don't know exactly why or how they're going to break free and make a life for themselves in this country, you just get a sense it's going to happen \u2013 maybe because they're a bit more desperate than the others, maybe they've got a few more IQ points than their friends. Who knows. He also thought, _This guy knows how to hustle_. Sure enough, when Keong called at the factory the following year to deliver another team of workers, Uzzal was no longer there. Found himself a wife, his colleagues said. A local. He'd quit his job and was working in a restaurant somewhere in town. It was easy finding him \u2013 he'd answered his phone within a few seconds of Keong calling.\n\nKeong's hunch was right. Uzzal knew all the Bangladeshis in the area \u2013 knew which ones were good workers, the ones with a bad attitude, the ones hiding an injury or a sickness that was soon going to finish them off. He knew the ones who were planning to run away from their jobs, knew where they hid \u2013 the invisible slums in town, on stretches of the riverbank, or out in the countryside, in the middle of the forest. He knew all the different routes migrants used to get into the country, by sea and especially by land, across the border from Thailand. He was familiar with all the techniques the smugglers used, from hiding human cargo in containers to plain old bribery. That was the most common. Customs officers see a big lorry loaded with sacks of rice or cages of live chickens, of course they know what's underneath all that. They could spend an hour unloading the lorry and finding the migrants hidden underneath, but pay them enough and they won't bother. Maybe they don't want to find the real stash; maybe they're afraid of discovering dead bodies, children suffocated in that tiny hollowed-out space under a mound of squawking chickens. Just because you work at a job like that, it doesn't mean you don't have feelings. But a tiny bit of cash makes it easy to turn your head and look the other way \u2013 someone actually pays you not to see dirty, upsetting shit. Anyone would do the same.\n\nUzzal knew all these tricks. He stashed them away in his head the way other people might do with money stuffed into a mattress. All that information \u2013 how to get in, how to get out, how to survive. He kept it secret, never revealing any of it to anyone except people who'd pay. Foreigners and employers alike. That was how he made his money.\n\n'Like I said,' Keong smiled, finishing his Carlsberg, 'I know a player when I see one.'\n\n'You go and see him yourself,' I said. 'It's none of my business.'\n\n'Hey, do you want your workers or not? You're going to get your ass fired.' He stood up and checked his watch. 'We'll find out from Uzzal where the workers are, then you can go home and tell your wife and boss that you've got things covered. Tomorrow I'll deliver the men to your farm, and you'll look back at this evening and think, \"Why the hell was I so grumpy? A favour for a friend. It was the easiest thing I ever did.\"'\n\nThe singer and her accompanist stopped for a break, sitting on a couple of plastic folding chairs next to the bar. Suddenly the lobby felt empty and silent \u2013 the cluster of people at the reception area had disappeared, and there was no one in the bar apart from us. Keong was staring at his empty glass, turning it slightly as if examining the traces of foam that left a snakeskin pattern. 'We're brothers, you have to back me up,' he said, his voice sounding flat and deflated once more. 'All I'm doing is trying to help you out here.'\n\nYou're thinking, Why didn't I just get up and leave? That moment of escape, of flight, presented itself, as it had done before and would do again. I recognised it for exactly what it was \u2013 an opportunity to say, 'You know what? This is too messy for me' \u2013 but spotting a chance and taking it are two separate and unconnected things. When faced with a door that's wide open, how many of us actually walk through it? We never take the chance to flee. We stay. We recognise the danger, but something in our brains tells us it isn't going to be so bad. We believe in life's power to iron out the kinks in our existence and make things turn out OK. We don't think anything fundamentally evil will occur to us. Everything will turn out just fine.\n\nI said, 'I'm tired. My head hurts.'\n\nKeong looked around the empty lobby, then reached into a pocket and took out a small plastic bag with three or four pills in it. 'Panadol,' he smiled. 'For your headache.'\n\nI knew what they were \u2013 definitely not painkillers. I shook my head. 'Call the waiter. Let's just get this deal done.'\n\nThe meeting point was a car park in the Old Town, an empty space in a row of shophouses where an old building had collapsed over time, or been torn down. The far end of the unsurfaced yard was shaded by a large tree from which vines hung thickly towards the ground, as impenetrable as curtains. It was here that we waited for Uzzal, listening to the traffic on the highway drifting across the night. It began to drizzle very lightly, and the sound of the rain on the leaves overhead seemed muffled, as if it was occurring some distance away, hundreds of feet in the air, and I had the impression of being separated from the noise around me, as if I was insulated by a giant bubble of invisible foam.\n\nKeong had taken a pill and was standing perfectly still, concentrating his gaze on the street. The pills gave him concentration, he said, made everything as clear and bright and optimistic as a magnificent sunrise. I remembered how he'd been a decade earlier, how he wouldn't sleep all night because the pills he'd taken gave him too much energy. 'Even if I climb Mount Everest I won't be able to sleep,' he used to say. Now he no longer displayed the nervous energy of before \u2013 he stood with his hands in his pockets, occasionally kicking at the gravel underfoot, but otherwise he moved very little. Every time a car approached he would stiffen and shrink back slightly into the shadows before relaxing once the glare of the headlights had faded. We stood well back from the soft orange glow of the street lamps. At that time of night there were few cars in this part of town, but I'd seen enough of Keong's work to know that caution was part of the job. It was part of _him_ , I thought. He didn't know any other way to live than in the shadows.\n\nWhen we heard the scooter approach we both knew it was Uzzal. The stutter of its motor as it slowed down. The way it glided into the unlit parts of the street, like a creature that instinctively seeks the margins. The deliberate dimming of its headlight before it was switched off altogether as it neared the parking lot. He killed the engine as he drew close, hopped off and pushed the scooter towards us. He seemed younger now than he had at the hotel, where he'd been dressed up in his waiter's uniform. His movements were quick and easy, and he covered the ground swiftly. I found it hard to believe he'd been in the country for ten years \u2013 he must have been a teenager when he arrived, I thought. A boy.\n\nKeong didn't move; he waited until Uzzal was close to us before speaking. 'I keep telling you,' he said, 'you should quit that lousy job of yours. The uniform makes you look like a penguin.'\n\nThe way Uzzal laughed gave me the impression that he and Keong knew each other better than I'd assumed. 'What am I supposed to do?' he said. 'Just wait for you to turn up and pay me a few hundred ringgit now and then? I got a wife and a kid to feed.' He parked the scooter, propping it up gently to make sure it didn't fall over on the uneven ground.\n\n'I forgot you're a dad now.'\n\n' _Ya_. Like being a waiter.'\n\nKeong laughed. 'You're a real joker.'\n\nUzzal was still smiling, but he was eyeing me, while also looking around as though there might have been others lurking in the darkness.\n\n'Don't worry, he's an old friend of mine,' Keong said. 'From childhood. A local boy. He's helping me sort out this mess.'\n\nUzzal kept his gaze on me for a while, taking in every bit of me, as if he might find something that would test the truth of Keong's statement about me. I wanted him to notice a detail \u2013 the way I dressed, the way I deliberately refrained from smiling, the heavy shoes I wore, suitable for light agricultural work, whatever minuscule note he'd think was suspicious, and that would indicate to him that I wasn't any of the things Keong had made me out to be. I was willing him on, silently urging him to say, That guy, he's no friend of yours, he's not like you. He's not one of us. Get him out of here, I don't trust him. I even shook my head, wanting to communicate to him that I was there by accident, that I had a home, a job, a wife \u2013 a whole separate life away from this shabby parking lot surrounded by derelict buildings.\n\nHe continued to stare at me for a few moments, and that was when I experienced, for the first time, that curious sensation I would encounter later that week, and again during my time in prison \u2013 of time slowing down, folding in on itself, almost as if it had taken a physical form and was collapsing, just like the buildings around us. I remembered the feeling I had when I was a child, of joyously sliding down an imaginary rabbit hole and emerging on another continent, or even another planet altogether, with landscapes and people that were so familiar to me I'd sometimes have trouble believing I was in a new place \u2013 only I was, because in these new surroundings I would understand how to make decisions, choices that would turn out all right for me and my family, and everyone else who populated this world would behave with similar clarity and ease. But now I wasn't a child. I knew such things couldn't happen. I don't know why that thought came to me at that moment. It was so ridiculous that I smiled to myself.\n\nUzzal turned to Keong and said, 'I know what you want, but I can't help you.'\n\nKeong laughed. 'You're kidding me, right?'\n\n'My friend, I can't help you.'\n\nKeong took a step towards Uzzal. Just a small, quick step, but it was enough to make Uzzal react \u2013 a tiny shuffle of his feet, a hardening of his stance to mask the instinctive reaction to back away.\n\n'I pay you but you don't help me,' said Keong. I wasn't sure if it was a question or a statement.\n\n'It's the boss. The one who got them into the country. He has the people you're looking for.'\n\n'My company paid that bastard to get them in, now he's hiding them. I'm going to get that damned Bangla, make him pay.'\n\nUzzal remained silent for a while, and in the half-dark I saw him look up towards the canopy of leaves overhead. It was still drizzling \u2013 so lightly that it felt like a fine mist on my face. He laughed, making a noise like a soft snort. 'He's doing you a favour.'\n\n'He'll do me a favour when he delivers the people he owes me, and gets the fuck out of here.'\n\n'You were supposed to get permits for them but you didn't, so what's he supposed to do? He can't just let them loose.'\n\nKeong took another step towards Uzzal. This time he did back away. 'That guy \u2013 he smuggles people into our country. And now he's telling _me_ to get permits?'\n\n'I'm just telling you what he told me,' Uzzal said firmly. 'If those people don't have permits, they can't work.'\n\nKeong laughed. A loud, full-throated roar that cut through the gentle hush of the rain and echoed against the walls of the parking lot. I looked around us, checking to see if there were any stray pedestrians passing by who might have heard the noise, but there was no one about. I was becoming like Keong and Uzzal, I thought \u2013 cautious, afraid.\n\n'Look at you, mister lawyer,' Keong said. 'Who the fuck cares about permits? Today we saw two hundred workers. Two hundred people without papers, working away happily. So don't give me that bullshit.'\n\n'I'm just telling you what he said.' Uzzal turned and walked to his scooter.\n\n'How much do you want?' said Keong. 'Find out where they are, I give you a thousand.'\n\nUzzal laughed but didn't turn around.\n\n'Hey, how much?' Keong shouted.\n\nUzzal climbed onto the scooter, but didn't turn on the engine. 'There are women in that group,' he said. 'And two children. They need papers.'\n\n'Which Bangla need papers? Once I have them, I'll sort things out.'\n\n'They're not from Bangladesh. They're Rohingya. They need refugee papers.'\n\n'Rohingya, Bangladesh \u2013 whatever. You're all the same.'\n\nUzzal started the engine and eased the scooter towards the road.\n\n'My friend will call round tomorrow,' Keong said. I knew he meant me. 'You give him the news. I'm going to sort out your Bangla boss.'\n\n'Even I don't know where he is,' Uzzal called out as he rode away slowly. Once he reached the road he flicked the headlight on, but it wasn't until he was some distance away that he began to accelerate.\n\nKeong cursed. Called Uzzal that name again, the one he used all the time for dark-skinned people. We walked towards my car, and the only thought in my mind was whether anyone had noticed it, parked where it shouldn't have been at that time of night, and been suspicious enough to write down the registration number. But of course no one had. I wouldn't have. It was ridiculous even to think that someone might have done, but that was what a couple of days with Keong did to my way of thinking.\n\n'Refugee papers. Do they know how long it takes to process those? None of the Rohingyas have them.' Keong lit a cigarette as he climbed into the car. 'I don't understand the difference between Rohingya and Bangladeshi. They all look the same to me. Can you tell which is which?'\n\nI shook my head. 'Listen, it's too complicated,' I said. 'Let's just forget the whole thing.' I was expecting him to argue with me, give me all the reasons I should continue to help him, make excuses for not telling me earlier all the things I'd suspected, which were now out in the open: that he was dealing not just with illegal migrants, which was bad enough, but half-dead refugees. I expected him to say that it wasn't such a big deal, because let's face it, how many foreigners are legal in the country these days, so why would he bother to tell me? He'd try to convince me that I needed to help him in order to help myself. He'd refer to the bonds of a friendship that had never really existed, but it would sound convincing because they meant something to me.\n\nInstead, he kept silent and lowered the window to let out the cigarette smoke. The wind shuddered through the car, reminding me of the long day we'd spent together, reminding me of my fatigue. 'Maybe you're right,' he said after a while. 'Maybe we should just forget this whole business. Pack up, go live on a desert island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.' He held his face close to the window and felt the rushing of the air, as if tasting it.\n\nI wanted to say, You fool, there are no desert islands in the Atlantic. But I was too tired to speak any more that night.\n\n##\n\nA noise. Nothing unusual, just a car. But I sit here all day, so I know the tiny variations in the sounds outside. Without even looking, I know that the car is a taxi, and that she is in it. For the first time since we started our talks, she is late.\n\nShe checks her watch as she comes through the gate.\n\nSorry I'm late.\n\nWhat happened to your car?\n\nI have a problem with it. But it's cool. I took the KTM Komuter to Klang, then a cab. It's no big deal.\n\nYour car broke down?\n\nShe steps into the house and sits down in her usual seat. Breathes out, slumps back in the chair as if she's just run ten miles and doesn't have enough strength to sit up straight.\n\nNo, it got taken away.\n\n_Ha_? Stolen?\n\nNo, towed away. DBKL guys did it right in front of my eyes. I was parked perfectly legally, my ticket had run out like one fucking minute before, and they were standing by ready to tow it away. Said if I paid them the fine they'd let me go, so I said, Fine, what fine? You mean BRIBE, and they just laughed in my face. _Ei Ah Moy, janganlah macam tu_. Jesus. I could have slapped them. Why the fuck do I put up with such misogyny? How dare they call me _Ah Moy_? Racist misogynists. I'd forgotten all about that sort of thing. Fuck.\n\nYour language. You're sounding like me.\n\nI don't care. Can you believe it? One minute. One stupid minute. They were laughing at me while I argued with them. Laughing and smoking. I couldn't do a damn thing. Right up until the truck came and took the car away.\n\nWhy didn't you just pay?\n\nShe stops and looks at me as if she can't understand what I said.\n\nIt's only fifty, a hundred bucks, I say. You should have just paid.\n\nShe narrows her eyes, and I get the feeling that I'm the one who's done something wrong, not the DBKL men who took her car away.\n\nThat's not the point! Why should I pay? I did nothing wrong. They were just out to make some extra cash, and I was _not going to pay_. Hello? That's called _corruption_. That's what's wrong with this country \u2013 everyone's just looking out for themselves, looking to make a quick buck at someone else's expense. Those idiots, they can just go _fuck themselves_.\n\nCalm down, stop shouting.\n\nI'm like, Do you even recognise this as corruption?\n\nPlease.\n\nShe pulls some papers out of her folder and puts her phone on the table, ready to record as usual.\n\nAnyway, no use in complaining. I'll deal with the process in due course. Now we have to get to work.\n\nNo. We're going to get your car back.\n\nI go into my bedroom to get the cash I keep in a biscuit tin in the wardrobe \u2013 the money I've managed to save over the last six or seven months. I don't know how much there is, so I take it all. Better to be safe. I come out and head straight to the door.\n\nWaiting for what? I say to her. Better deal with the problem now.\n\nAt the car pound she insists I stand to one side, tells me not to say anything.\n\nYou think just because I'm a woman I can't deal with this sort of thing? she says.\n\n_Aiya_ , don't say like that. I'm just coming to support you. What can a guy like me do to help anyway?\n\nI pretend to read the announcements on the noticeboard, but actually I'm listening to the argument she's having with the guy at the desk. I say argument, but in fact she's the only one talking, trying to persuade him to cancel the fine.\n\nThe parking warden should have exercised discretion, she says, I was only one minute late. We should reform the system to make it fair and flexible.\n\nThe guy isn't even looking at her. He's staring at the screen of his phone, his thumb gently swiping at it every few seconds.\n\nShe raises her voice. Hey, listen to me! You're so rude. She's almost shouting.\n\nSorry miss, rules are rules. He smiles and starts to flick through a newspaper.\n\n_You people are hopeless. How do you expect this country to progress if you behave like this?_\n\nHer voice is so loud that people at the other end of the room turn and stare at her. I'm afraid of what might happen next, even if she is not. One of the other men \u2013 they are all men in that office \u2013 stands up and says, What's that stupid girl shouting about?\n\nStupid girl? she shouts. Who are you calling a stupid girl? You want to come out and say that to my face?\n\nHey hey hey OK OK. I come and stand next to her at the counter. No problem here, I say. We just want the car back.\n\nYou know something? the man who has just stood up says. Your fine is now one thousand ringgit. _Ya_ , it's gone up, because yours is a special case.\n\nWhat? You can't do that, she shouts.\n\nHey, _Ah Moy_. Rules are rules.\n\nYou know what? she says. Keep the damn car.\n\nShe turns and walks quickly out of the office. There's air-con in the room, but it still feels very hot. The men are looking at their phones or flicking through magazines. It's as if we'd never entered the office, never even existed.\n\nI find her outside, sitting in the shade of a tree on a low concrete wall. Behind her are the remains of some small plants that are slowly dying in the heat. The bare earth is dry.\n\nI really need a cigarette, she says.\n\nI hold out my hand and open my palm.\n\nWhat the hell? she says, staring at the car keys. How did you get it back?\n\nI shrug.\n\nYou paid a bribe?\n\nHow else?\n\nHow much did you pay? Oh God, you shouldn't have done that. You're just perpetuating the system. You're encouraging those guys.\n\nFrom the time I give her the keys until we find the car and get into it, she doesn't stop lecturing me.\n\nIt's because of people like you that they dare to ask for bribes. Corruption is a two-way thing. The victim doesn't even know they're a victim. In fact, you could say that the victim becomes not only the enabler of corruption, but the perpetrator.\n\n_Aiya_ , enough already. I'm sorry, OK? I just wanted to get the car back.\n\nWe drive out of the parking lot and into the traffic. Neither of us says anything. Finally, when we reach the Meru road, she says, How much did you pay?\n\nSix hundred.\n\n_Ha_ , they gave you a discount.\n\nIt was all I had with me.\n\nShe doesn't answer, and I think maybe she doesn't want to talk about it any more. But after a while she says, That's a lot of money. I'm sorry.\n\nIt's fine, forget it.\n\nWe drive on in silence, and it isn't until we're almost back at my house that she speaks again. Thank you, she says. I appreciate it. I'm sorry I yelled.\n\nThat night I open the biscuit tin. It's been a long time since I've seen it completely empty, so I take one of the four ten-ringgit notes that are still in my wallet and put it in the tin. I know it's a meaningless thing to do, but it makes me feel I still have some money to spare. I make a quick mental note of how much food I have, how many days I can live before I get some money. As I fall asleep I tell myself, It'll be fine.\n\n##\n\n_December 20th_\n\n'Have you taken up smoking again?' Jenny asked. We'd only just got into the car and she was doing up her seatbelt. 'Stinks in here.'\n\n'No,' I replied. It was the truth. But the smell of Keong's cigarettes was everywhere, hanging in the air even when I flicked the air-con to max and lowered the windows.\n\n'It's really horrible.' She put her forearm to her nose and sniffed it. 'It's even getting into my clothes.'\n\nStill, after a few minutes she was forced to raise the window on her side of the car. The wind was blowing dust into her eyes, and her hair was starting to look dishevelled. She'd spent a long time getting ready for the conference that morning, and we hadn't spoken much from the moment we woke up. Sometimes, when she had something important going on with her work, I'd feel that anything I said would break the spell of her concentration \u2013 the sound of my voice felt rough and inappropriate, especially when I was not long out of bed and my throat was still a bit dry from sleep. That morning she was preparing for a gathering of all the people who sold Skin-Glo, which was being held at a convention centre on Leboh Gopeng. She'd got out of bed a little before me, and as I prepared breakfast I could hear her typing quickly on her laptop. She'd been one of the few people selected to give a speech at the conference. This involved her putting together a presentation filled with colourful interlocking circles and wavy graphs, which she'd spliced together with photographs of happy people who used Skin-Glo. I brought her tea and eggs \u2013 she liked them boiled for two minutes and broken into a shallow saucer, the way you get in old Hainanese _kopitiam_ \u2013 and set the tray down quietly next to her. I looked at the screen \u2013 she was flicking through the pages of her presentation, her lips moving as she silently rehearsed her speech \u2013 and saw that she'd added a few photographs I hadn't seen in a long time, and hadn't noticed in the jumble of material she'd accumulated on her desk. I'd been so distracted by events at work that I hadn't asked her how her work was going.\n\nThere were five or six photos, of Jenny or the two of us. The first was of her standing in front of the Merlion in Singapore, on a trip we'd taken not long after we got married. We were going to save up for a proper honeymoon \u2013 a week or two abroad, somewhere nice like Taiwan, where we'd put on smart clothes and pose for portraits in Alishan or Sun Moon Lake: pictures we could then frame and use as decorations in our living room the way other people did. We'd talked about Phuket, too \u2013 we had visions of ourselves dressed in flowing white outfits that blended into the perfect sand on the beach, snaps of ourselves doing star jumps against the backdrop of a sea so brilliantly blue and green that no one would believe it was real. _Like the colours of a peacock_ , Jenny had said.\n\nBut all that lay in the future, when we had a bit more time and money, so in the meantime we thought we'd spend a long weekend in Singapore. Four days, nothing fancy, just looking at the shop windows on Orchard Road and seeing the orchids in the botanical gardens. We stayed with relatives of Jenny's in their apartment in Toa Payoh, with a view looking over the rest of the estate, rows and rows of identical apartment blocks \u2013 white and rectangular, with strips of darkened windows on each floor, lined up like soldiers on parade. Between them, neat squares of concrete or patches of grass. The sound of people singing to a karaoke set in the distance. Our room was so small that there was barely space to walk around the bed, and as we sat on the mattress listening to the conversations of the people going past on the walkway just outside \u2013 what they were planning to eat at the food court, what bus they were going to take to get into town \u2013 we joked that it was _just like being in a luxury hotel_. Outside, in the living room, the TV was on, the volume turned up loud because Jenny's aunt was getting older and starting to lose her hearing. A Korean drama, dubbed into Mandarin. _Big brother! Big brother!_ a woman's voice screamed over and over again. Jenny and I laughed. 'We need to get the fuck out of here,' I said.\n\nWe spent the whole of the next two days out, only returning to the apartment late in the evening, when Jenny's relatives had gone to bed and the TV was finally off. We walked in the sun, got sweaty, went into air-conditioned malls to cool down. We strolled around the marina, posing for photos in front of the Merlion and the carpeted steps of the Fullerton Hotel, as if we were staying there. Other guests \u2013 real ones \u2013 came up the stairs and nodded at us as if in acknowledgement, and we nodded back. Later, we couldn't stop laughing at the idea that they'd thought we were just like them. 'We should go to Raffles tomorrow,' Jenny said. 'Pretend we're staying there too.' We went to the cinema and saw _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_. It was nearly the end of the movie's run, and the cinema was half-empty. We sat near the front because we wanted the screen to feel as huge and all-engulfing as possible; the sound drummed in our ribcages and we felt its vibrations even after we'd left and were having _mee pok_ and barbecued wings at a late-night hawker centre in Balestier.\n\nOn the second day I caught a chill from the air-con in the bus on the way home, and came down with a cold. On the third day Jenny fell sick too, and we spent the afternoon in bed. It was so hot and sticky that we had to keep the windows open. We lay there for hours, listening to Jenny's relatives preparing dinner, talking loudly over the noise of the TV. We wanted to hold each other but we both had a mild fever, we were too hot and sweaty, so we lay side by side, her hand on mine. _Why are you doing this to me?_ a man screamed on TV \u2013 one of those stilted dubbed voices. We began to giggle.\n\n'Promise me our real honeymoon won't be like this,' I said.\n\n'What are you talking about?' Jenny replied. 'This is all the honeymoon you're going to get!'\n\nShe was joking, of course, and so was I. But as the months dragged on and it became clear that we weren't going to go away on a honeymoon anytime soon \u2013 because of work, because we didn't have enough money just yet \u2013 the talking about possible honeymoon destinations became just that: talk. We'd see adverts for cruises to Benoa, or tours to see the cherry blossom in Kyoto, and we'd discuss how much we'd have to save up for the trip, how we'd tell our respective bosses that we'd like to take ten whole days off work. 'Mr Lai will kill you before he lets you take ten days off to look at cherry blossom!' Jenny joked. She mimicked his voice: ' _You turned into a woman, meh? Take holiday go see flower?_ '\n\nAt some point we stopped using the word 'honeymoon' when we discussed these fantasy trips abroad. I guess we'd stopped thinking of our marriage as something that needed to be celebrated, or cemented, by something as sentimental as a honeymoon. We'd missed the chance to do something only available to newlyweds. I'm sure Jenny felt the same way I did. We were both old enough then to know that in life, these lost opportunities never come round again.\n\nAnd yet. Looking over Jenny's shoulder that morning, and seeing those photos that she'd included in her presentation, I wondered if our trip to Singapore all those years ago had been more than just a long weekend. I looked at the photo of Jenny in a hawker centre, holding an _ang ku kuih_ to her lips as if it was an oversized clown's mouth, bright red and fleshy. Another of me in bed the day I came down with the cold, my hair roughed up and even spikier than usual. In the photo I am pulling a sad face which somehow manages to look comical and happy \u2013 so ridiculous that it made me smile all those years later. I remembered handing the camera to an old man who was walking by in the botanical gardens, and asking him to take a photo of Jenny and me. He had difficulty framing us, and backed away. Jenny started to get nervous \u2013 she was worried that he was going to run off with our camera \u2013 but I said, 'Don't worry, this is Singapore. No one steals anything.' In the photo we are striking a pose around a tree fern, in the style of Bollywood actors \u2013 hands clasped, arms forming a neat circle. Our smiles are exaggerated, but they were real.\n\nAbove the photos, Jenny had written the words 'My Life', followed by 'Happiness' and 'Skin-Glo'. She continued looking at the computer screen, but her lips had stopped moving. I went back to the kitchen and made myself a cup of Nescaf\u00e9. I was still thinking of those four days in Singapore, which I'd almost forgotten. And I experienced a sense of loss, though I couldn't discern what it was that I'd lost. Maybe nothing. Maybe everything. Sometimes, we don't realise something's happening until it's over, and then it's too late to celebrate it \u2013 you can only regret its passing.\n\n'I hope your presentation goes well,' I said as we drove slowly through traffic. Jenny was leaning forward, sniffing the air-con vents for traces of cigarette smoke. 'I'm sure you'll be great.'\n\n'If people like my presentation, I might get a lot more customers.'\n\n'I'm sure you'll get loads. You deserve it.'\n\n'I've heard that someone's going to make a video of the presentations and send it to head office in America. People in Colorado are going to be watching me!'\n\n'That's amazing.'\n\n'I had a dream a few nights ago that when I finished my presentation, the whole auditorium gave me a standing ovation. People were chanting my name. By the time I got back to my seat, the head of operations in Hong Kong had already offered me a job in KL. She wanted me to move there immediately. Then all the salespeople from other parts of the country came up to congratulate me. Actually, I wasn't asleep when I dreamed that, so it wasn't a true dream. More like a vision of what could happen. Why shouldn't it? One special moment is all it takes to change your life. Imagine. This time next month, maybe even next week, we could be looking at houses in Damansara Heights or Kenny Hills. Choosing furniture.'\n\n'I don't really know KL that well. Anyway, our house is nice, isn't it?'\n\nShe fell silent, and when I glanced at her I saw her lips moving silently, rehearsing her speech again. Her eyes were trained straight ahead, and I knew that she was looking not at the smoky exhaust pipe of the van in front of us, but at an auditorium full of attentive salespeople.\n\n'How's your work, by the way?' she asked after a while. 'Did you sort out that manpower problem?'\n\n'Yes. Yes, I did. Well, almost. Everything will be finalised soon. Things will be even better than before. You know, sometimes you have to face serious problems at work before you can move to the next level. That's something I've heard you say in the past, and it's true. I'm only learning that now.'\n\nShe turned to me and smiled. 'I feel very optimistic about the future.'\n\n'Me too.' We were nearing the convention centre, and the traffic was flowing more freely than before.\n\n'Mr Lai will finally give you the huge bonus you deserve for saving his farm, and we'll use that as the down-payment for our new house in KL.'\n\n'Maybe.'\n\n'You have to stay positive,' she said brightly. 'Be like me. Have faith in yourself!'\n\n'You're going to be late.'\n\n'You'll see,' she said, reaching for her briefcase. 'Everything will turn out great.'\n\nLooking at her then, I truly believed her.\n\n'Wish me luck,' she said as she stepped out of the car.\n\n##\n\nYou've been smoking.\n\nHuh? She looks up at me briefly, but quickly returns to her notes, as though she hasn't really heard me. She coughs. A rich, wet cough.\n\nI said, you've been smoking. Haven't you?\n\nSo what? You smoked for years.\n\nIt's bad for your health.\n\nLook who's talking. You were smoking at fifteen.\n\nBut I stopped, didn't I? You look very tired.\n\nI'm OK.\n\nShe starts to cough again and tries to stifle it, but she can't. The cough is stronger than she is \u2013 the more she tries to suppress it, the worse it gets. She bends over, covering her face with her hands. Her back is heaving, as though the cough has taken over her whole body. Finally she stands up and goes to the bathroom, and I can hear more coughing. When she comes back I give her a cup of hot water and some cough sweets.\n\nI don't need sweets, I need a cigarette.\n\nYou joking? You're an amateur. You don't even know how to smoke. Drink some water, it'll make you feel better.\n\nShe takes a sip of water and slumps in her chair.\n\nI don't feel so good, she says. Her voice is hoarse.\n\nYou don't look well. Do you have a fever?\n\nShe touches her brow. No, I don't think so. I'm not ill. Maybe I am. But it's not a physical sickness.\n\nI see. A love problem, huh. With your partner? You've never told me her name.\n\nMy ex-partner.\n\nSorry?\n\nWe broke up at the weekend. I mean, I broke up with her.\n\nYou're joking, right? It was going so well, you were so happy.\n\nShe shrugs. I just realised I couldn't actually live with her. We're too different. Of course we knew that before we got together, but we thought we could overcome our differences. We thought love could conquer all, blah blah. But you know what? It can't. So I thought, better to end it quickly than endure a long, angry decline.\n\nYou sure? I mean, you've only just moved in together. Maybe it's because you're not used to each other yet. When Jenny and I got married and started living together we fought over everything. I didn't wash up my cup, _fight_. She didn't close the door properly, _fight_. We didn't know how to share a house. Then, after a while, it all disappeared, and I even got anxious when she wasn't at home. What I'm saying is, maybe you should give it more time. Learn to live with her.\n\nIt's not that. The apartment is huge, we have tons of space. We don't get in each other's way. Our differences are... let's say, too deep to be bridged.\n\nWhy? You love her, don't you?\n\nI just can't stand her principles. Her politics. She's so... so fucking _conservative._ Such a reactionary. Thinks everything is fine, and that the only thing wrong is that poor people don't work hard enough. You know what she said the other day? Our friend Shafik got mugged. Some guy on a scooter went by and grabbed his phone. My partner said, _It's all these migrant workers we let in. They're the ones who commit all the crimes._ Obviously I went ballistic. I told her that statistically, foreign workers commit only 10 per cent of all crimes in the country. You know what she said? _Huh, why don't you tell that to the old woman who's just been beaten and robbed, or the seventeen-year-old girl who got raped in Setapak last week. We should just deport them._ She's an educated person, she's rich, she should know better than to peddle such nonsense! I tried to convince her otherwise, but she just shrugged. _Whatever_ , she said. _The facts speak for themselves._\n\nMaybe she's right.\n\nShe's wrong!\n\nSo you don't agree on crime. Is that a reason to split up?\n\nIt's not just that. It's everything. Her whole politics. She's a corporate lawyer, right, so I know she's a capitalist, but I didn't expect her to turn out to be so damned conservative. All she thinks about is making money. She had a small Honda when I met her, now she has a huge Audi 4\u00d74. What next, a Bentley? I joked. She said, _Mmm, maybe in a couple of years' time_.\n\nWhat's wrong with making money? Your family are well-off too, aren't they?\n\nWe're not rich, but yeah, we're OK. That's precisely why I'm trying to do more interesting things with my life. Useful things. Her parents are so _stinking_ rich. Why does she need more? What makes me sad is that she wasn't always like that. I remember the first time I saw her. She was sitting alone reading a trashy novel in the Hungarian Pastry Shop. In New York. We were both studying there. She was smiling to herself as she read, and shaking her head, as if she was reading the funniest thing in the world, and I thought, Now _that_ is someone I could live with my whole life. She was fun, she loved to laugh. It wasn't that __ long ago. Now we sit on the sofa and discuss mortgage rates all evening.\n\nShe's just trying to provide you with security for the future. If you don't have a nice house, how can you feel safe?\n\nYou know the worst thing of all? She supports the government. Doesn't see why I went on the anti-corruption march, said it was a waste of time. Actually laughed at me and my friends, as if we were kids. _Yeah, just go and pretend to be revolutionaries, if it makes you feel better. You're crazy if you think you'll change anything._ I felt like leaving the apartment and slamming the door and never seeing her again.\n\nShe stares at her cup of water, but doesn't drink. She keeps her head lowered, and I think, Maybe she's crying.\n\nDo you love her?\n\nHow can I live with someone who votes for this corrupt government?\n\nThat's not what I asked. I said, do you love her?\n\nShe keeps looking at her cup, but still doesn't take a sip. When she finally lifts her head to look at me she sighs heavily.\n\nShe's called Alex. Actually her real name is Intan Alexandra Sulaiman, but all her friends call her Alex.\n\n##\n\n_December 30th_\n\nLast night I woke up with a jolt. One moment I was in a deep sleep, the next I was fully awake. My head was still on the pillow, my entire body as it had been in the minutes and hours before that rupture, but suddenly I was as alert and clear-eyed as I am right now, sitting here talking to you. It was a crack of thunder that woke me up. A single streak of lightning that came out of nowhere and split the night neatly in two. I don't know what the weather's been like in your part of town \u2013 sometimes when it's raining heavily here, it's as dry as the Sahara where you are. Thirty miles away, but everything can be different where you live. Out here, the skies have been heavy for days now, full of the sort of thick low cloud that usually announces downpours that last for days, even weeks \u2013 only we haven't had any rain at all. Every morning I keep thinking, Better not go out today, the rain will be too heavy and there won't be any buses. Every evening I smell the moisture in the air and expect to hear the drumming of rain on the roof in the night, but in the end nothing happens. Just a lightless blue-grey sky full of swollen, twisted clouds, like strange ripe fruit about to burst.\n\nThen, last night, that single, sharp crack of thunder, like an oil drum splitting in two. My eyes flicked open. I waited for the next burst of lightning. That's it, I thought, here comes the rain at last. But still nothing. I lay awake for a while, not even blinking, just listening, waiting, even when enough time had passed for me to know that there would be no deluge after all. Thunder in a dry sky \u2013 that was all it had been. As I drifted back to sleep I wondered whether I'd simply dreamed it; that maybe the sharpness of the lightning strike, the loud booming of the thunder \u2013 all that had occurred in my mind, and nowhere else. I get caught in this state sometimes, trapped between two worlds, not knowing if I'm fully awake and present in one, or if I've actually passed into another. Sleeping, running, raining, burning. Sometimes it's all the same to me, I can't discern the difference, can't shake myself into a state of clarity and divide my days into distinct portions with lists of things to do. It's worse since I came out of prison, but to tell the truth I've always been a bit like that, even when I was small. Look at the sky. It's the same as yesterday and all the days before. This morning the alarm clock told me it was seven-thirty, but it was so dark I didn't feel as if night had properly ended.\n\n[ _Rubs eyes; pauses; stares into space._ ]\n\nI almost didn't recognise Uzzal when he walked out of the Tokyo Hotel. I'd been waiting for him for more than an hour, watching the back entrance that led into the side street where there was hardly any traffic. I'd parked my car just across the street, where I was sure to spot him \u2013 yet I still almost missed him. He'd changed out of his hotel uniform and was wearing long camouflage shorts and a Liverpool football shirt, the kind of clothes you might expect a local to wear, not a foreign worker.\n\nIt was very hot that day, and even with the car windows fully wound down there was very little air, and I was sweating heavily. The drains that lined the side street were clogged with rubbish \u2013 the usual tangle of biscuit tins and plastic bags and broken branches. It wasn't surprising that people got sick, I thought. Once the rain started it would only take a week of heavy downpours for all the trash to accumulate in a great heap that would block the deep monsoon drains, and then the town would be flooded. I could see it so clearly: the street in front of me disappearing slowly under a rising tide of floodwater, bits of driftwood and plastic floating in the muddy filth, bacteria spreading everywhere. The awnings of the makeshift food stalls huddled against the sides of the buildings would be sagging limply into the water. I'd sit there watching it, trapped in my car, and after a while, even with the doors and windows closed, I'd notice water seeping in through tiny cracks, maybe even through the undercarriage of the car itself. Was that even possible? In any case, eventually I'd feel the car begin to shift, feel the weightlessness of it as the water carried me away in its stream, along with the other bits of rubbish.\n\nIt was then that I noticed someone walking swiftly from the back entrance of the hotel to a row of scooters parked nearby, and it was only once he'd started to put on his helmet that I realised it was Uzzal. I started to get out of my car, but the lights of his scooter were already on, and a puff of exhaust billowed out from the engine as he drew away. I got back in the car and began to follow him, not caring whether he saw me or not. It was the opposite of all those cop films you see on Astro, where Aaron Kwok or Andy Lau is always trying not to be noticed as they trail someone in an SUV, but their target always sees them anyway, and they end up in a high-speed chase. I wanted Uzzal to spot me, but he didn't, he just rode through the traffic at a steady pace, not slow but not fast either, sometimes speeding up and disappearing between lorries, at other times waiting patiently at traffic lights.\n\nI got closer to him as the traffic thinned out beyond Taman Kelana, and just as we were approaching the Sementa area he turned off into an industrial area separated from the main road by a monsoon drain and a row of small trees so covered in road dust that they were more grey than green. It was a place I'd driven past often but never paid any attention to. A lot of the small factories and go-downs there had ceased to operate over the years, and it was hard to tell which were still in business and which were abandoned. The port business isn't what it used to be, and now that so much work is done by computers, there isn't any need for a lot of things we used to take for granted. One of the factories facing the highway had a sign that showed paper, pencils, wastepaper bins, but the place had long since closed down, shrouded by trees whose branches and vines hung so thickly they would soon hide the building from view entirely.\n\nUzzal drew to a halt outside a long, high fence of red-painted corrugated iron topped with two strands of rusty barbed wire. It looked as if it was protecting a small industrial unit \u2013 behind it I could see a flat-topped concrete roof, but I could also make out lines of washing. I pulled up alongside him just as he was pushing his scooter through the gate of the compound. When he looked at me, his eyes were clear and slightly wet, irritated from having ridden through the dust on the road. He didn't recognise me at first, but then he said, 'I already told you, I can't help.'\n\n'Please,' I said. 'I've got nothing to do with Keong. I don't even know the man.' _I don't know him_. As I was saying these words, they didn't seem like a lie, they seemed to form a truth so perfect and deep that I myself was convinced I'd never set eyes on Keong. Maybe it was my dreamlife speaking, my desire never to have known him. In that other life \u2013 the one that was safe and decent and true \u2013 Keong had never been a friend. 'I have a family. A job. I'm in trouble.'\n\n'I can't do anything for you,' he said, propping his scooter against a wall. There were other people in the yard, men and women washing clothes in plastic buckets. Two children stood on the steps of the building, framed by the doorway, ready to disappear inside at the slightest sign of trouble. The older one \u2013 seven or eight, with enough life behind her to recognise danger \u2013 stared at me with the closed look of someone who did not welcome strangers; the kind of expression she had no doubt encountered all her life on the faces of the people who looked at her as she walked in the street, to the extent that she had absorbed it herself, and it was now fixed on her own features. _Don't come any closer. Go away_. That was what her young face said. She had one arm around the shoulders of her sister, who must have been a couple of years younger at least, not yet closed off to the world, though that would come soon.\n\nI had once been those children, standing on the threshold of our house, watching people approach and judging the danger they posed to us. Debt collectors, people from the village, distant relatives from out of town. At first I was caught between fascination and fear, but later I became suspicious of everything. I suppose there must have been a time when I feared nothing and was enthralled by the newness of all people and all things, but I can't remember that time.\n\nI explained my situation to Uzzal without needing to add or exaggerate. I told him I would be sacked and my wife would leave me, and I would be alone again. I would have to start from scratch like a young man of twenty, only the body I lived in now was not a twenty-year-old's, and it might not be capable of creating a new life for me. That was why I was scared. Already, my body would often not obey my commands; my thoughts and my actions were diverging. Even if I wanted to work at a job digging trenches and ponds at a fish farm somewhere else in the country, my body would refuse to do it. If I had to go back to sharing a room with two other guys in a low-cost flat two hours from where I worked, my body would rebel, it wouldn't be able to take any rest on the thin mattress on the floor after a day in the sun.\n\n'Now that you work as a waiter in a hotel, can you imagine doing an eighteen-hour shift in a factory again?' I asked.\n\nUzzal looked at his children, and went up the steps to greet them. He took the smaller one in his arms and picked her up. The older one leaned lightly against him. She still hadn't shifted her hard-eyed gaze from me. Uzzal turned to go into the house, and beckoned me to join him inside. Beyond the initial gloom the concrete space was lit by a brilliant square of light that fell from a hole cut in the roof. Around us, in a large room that must once have housed light machinery, there were plastic chairs and makeshift beds spread out on the floor. In one corner, a sort of kitchen built from plywood boxes arranged against the wall, a small stove and a row of three gas canisters.\n\n'If those explode,' I said, 'you'll be in heaven before you know what's happened.'\n\nHe lit the stove and began to heat the kettle. 'How do you know it won't be hell?'\n\nThe children went out into the yard to play. They'd arranged some sticks on the broken concrete, and were hopping over them in a pattern that I couldn't figure out. They spoke in a language I didn't understand, but once in a while, amid the warm swirl of their chatter I heard a few Malay words, as striking as trees poking out from the water at high tide. _Satu_ , _dua_ , _tigaaaaaa_. I looked around the concrete box that Uzzal and his family had made their home, and I thought, It's dry and safe, and that's something.\n\nMore than just the three of them lived there, that much was clear. There were bags of clothes and pairs of rubber sandals everywhere. But where were they? He must have had a wife, and maybe cousins from his village in Bangladesh, or friends he'd grown up with. I didn't ask, and he didn't volunteer any information. With migrant workers, you learn not to ask questions about their families \u2013 you steer clear of the topic, because you don't want to hear the explanations. How did you end up in this country? What happened to your parents? Where is your wife? How did your husband die? You know that the stories are always going to be the same \u2013 you've heard them before, read about them in the newspapers \u2013 and if you don't have the stomach to hear them again, you learn not to ask questions.\n\nHe gave me some tea in a steel mug. It was hot and slightly bitter.\n\n'You should stop your search,' he said. 'The people you're looking for \u2013 they can't work.'\n\n'We can arrange permits,' I said. 'We can bribe the police, it'll be OK.'\n\n'It's not a question of law, it's a question of reality. They're sick, they're too weak to work. It's useless.'\n\nI was thirsty, but the tea was too strong for me to drink. 'Are you sure?'\n\nHe nodded. Their journey had been harsh, he explained, harsher than usual; most of them hadn't arrived in good shape. They'd taken a boat from southern Myanmar, from a place called Sittwe, not far from where he himself had grown up. From there they'd taken the usual sea route to southern Thailand, cutting in from the Andaman Islands and heading to the point where Thailand narrowed into Malaysia. It wasn't such a long trip, and conditions were good at that time of the year, between monsoons, the waves gentle. He'd done almost the same trip some time before, from further up the coast towards Chittagong, in fact, so he knew how long it would take.\n\nBut something went wrong, the boat got lost, they ran out of water days before they reached shore, and people died \u2013 he wasn't sure how many. All it takes is for one or two people on board to die and it changes the way you feel on the boat, changes the way you feel about the days, months and years ahead of you. Even if your body holds up, your spirit wishes you were dead. Drifting on the sea, you feel you've died too. The friends you lose take something away from you as their bodies are thrown overboard, and that something \u2013 what is it? No one knows \u2013 that something never comes back.\n\nOnce they'd reached land, they were held in jungle camps in southern Thailand, recovering enough strength for the journey across the border. One or two bodies \u2013 of people who'd died after they landed \u2013 were buried in the jungle. This happened often. When Uzzal was in one of those camps he had to dig a grave for a seventeen-year-old boy he'd met on the boat who'd dreamed of becoming a carpenter. Why a carpenter? Uzzal never found out. The boy had got sick with dysentery, and died of dehydration. As Uzzal was digging his grave, he kept thinking, This could be me. If I die, someone else will be digging my grave, and I'll be buried here, in the soil of a country I don't know, before I even have a chance of getting to know it. My body will nourish the earth of this new land, I will give myself to it after all, just not in the way I expected. (The Chinese have a saying, I wanted to tell him right at that moment, but I didn't. _Falling leaves return to nourish the tree's roots_. Do you know it? All things go back to their source. Wander far and wide, but you'll always return home. That is the natural way of things, that is how we expect life to turn out, and maybe it does for some. But not for most.)\n\nThey were smuggled in lorries across the border, all the way down into southern Perak, and now they were in the area, moving from one makeshift camp to another. Uzzal's so-called boss, the one Keong was looking for, was trying to find them medication, but it's hard to get help for people who aren't supposed to be in the country. That's what Uzzal had heard \u2013 that many of this group of workers were sick and dying. It didn't sound good. Not so long ago he might have stepped in, tried to do something to help them, maybe house them with families that were already established in the country, people who could nurse them, give them the shelter and comfort that was more healing than any medication. But these weren't the sort of people he knew. They were Rohingya. Do you know what that means? They were refugees, they lived in a war zone, they were being driven from their homes, they would have been weak and injured even before they set off on their journey. When you come from a place like that, it's not just your body that suffers, your brain is fried too, and Uzzal didn't know how to help people like that. The smugglers don't care who they bring in, they just count the numbers. As long as they fill the boats, they're happy. A man or a woman \u2013 they're just a body. That's what Uzzal's boss said one day, but Uzzal already knew it, he'd known it since the day he left Bangladesh. He knew because he'd once been that body himself.\n\nThat was when he decided he wouldn't be part of this business any more, and that was why he couldn't help me. He had a job now, a proper one. He'd got his papers, and in a few years he hoped to get a passport. He couldn't get involved in this kind of work, he had to leave it all behind.\n\n'What am I supposed to do?' I said. My voice sounded suddenly too loud; it reverberated in the concrete room. I wanted to shake him by the shoulders, scream at him. What did he think \u2013 that he could leave it all behind just like that, and forget all about it?\n\n'It's not my problem,' he said, finishing his tea. We were still standing in the middle of the room, and he looked at me for a few seconds before taking my mug from me. 'I have to make dinner for my kids now.'\n\nI can't explain to you how it happened \u2013 how my hands reached out suddenly, violently, to push him sharply in the chest. It was both a surprise and not a surprise to me. In my head, I was registering the fact that I'd reached a dead end with Uzzal, and that he wasn't going to help me in any way. I'd even begun to imagine how angry Mr Lai would be when he came back to discover his farm without any workers \u2013 without me. I'd begun to imagine Keong sulking for a few days before disappearing back to KL with his ego hurt.\n\nThat should have been the end of it. I should have been walking away by then. So I don't know why I struck him like that. It was just a push, not even very hard, but it caught us both by surprise, and he stumbled backwards, just a couple of steps, not enough to fall over, but enough to unbalance him. The tea from my mug splashed onto the concrete floor, and we both stared at the stain, as if that was the most important thing in the world at that moment. Outside, the children were still playing, counting out numbers in a sing-song manner. _Tu-juh-be-las-la-pan-be-las_...\n\nI turned to leave, but as I reached the doorway Uzzal called out.\n\n'I can give you his number,' he said. 'The man you're looking for. I don't know where he is, and I don't want to know. Take his number, but don't say who gave it to you.'\n\nI forwarded the number to Keong, but didn't get a reply. Later, lying on the sofa at home, I heard my phone buzz and vibrate on the dining table. I didn't bother to get up and look at it; I just continued to flick through the channels on TV, not watching anything in particular. When I finally listened to my messages, Keong's voice sounded unusually flat and calm. _You're my brother. You're the best._\n\n##\n\nBut it's illegal, she says.\n\nSo? Just because something's illegal doesn't mean it doesn't happen.\n\nWe have laws against that sort of thing. I mean, the kind of abuse you're talking about. We have rules against exploitation and brutality. Child labour. We do have regulations.\n\nI laugh. Do you know which country you're living in? You think you're in Switzerland or Singapore? Miss, this is the real world. Even in New York or wherever you did your studies, you think illegal stuff doesn't happen?\n\nI know, I'm not na\u00efve. But even so.\n\nYou don't believe me?\n\nNo, it's not that. It's just that some of what you describe is... pretty difficult to take in.\n\nI look at her and shrug. Sometimes I can't help it. When I talk about things that are unpleasant, I know that I should choose my words more carefully, try to make the story more pleasant and acceptable to her. I look at the phone that is recording my voice, and her pen scribbling in her notebook. I want her to think, _I like this story_. I know I should be more measured and tell a nice story, but I end up doing the opposite. I tell her every terrible detail, I can't stop myself. _Hold back, hold back_ , I think, but it all tumbles out despite myself. She doesn't say anything, doesn't interrupt, and that makes me talk even more. Today when I told her about the stories I'd heard from foreign workers who'd travelled from Bangladesh, I'd had a simple line prepared in my head. _It was a very difficult journey, people died._ But instead I told her exactly what I'd heard from the foreign worker I met. The smugglers slashing the stomach of his dead wife so her body wouldn't balloon and she'd sink quickly when thrown overboard. Migrants who were so weak they were dying, and still they had to dig graves. Their own graves. So when they died the smugglers could just push them in. No strength to fight, just enough strength to die. People seeing the gangrene set into their wounds, feeling that their legs were being gnawed at by an animal.\n\nShe would look up, her face pale as the moon, her eyes wide and confused like a child's when they hear bad news. At first I wanted to protect her from these stories, but as I was talking I realised that I wanted her to be a part of that pain, to make sure that it seeped into her world, her clean, happy world. I wanted it to be a cloud that hung over her everywhere she went, just as it does over me, all the time, and that's why I didn't stop talking. But each time I finish, the inevitable happens. I feel ashamed for having introduced this bitterness into her life, and then I feel like scrubbing it all away, except I can't, I can't repent in any way. I can't even say sorry. (What for, anyway?) I feel completely powerless. So I just sit there.\n\nHmm, she says after a pause. That's very hard to digest.\n\n## IV\n\n## JANUARY\n\n##\n\n_January 2nd_\n\nThe day before I was supposed to meet Keong and the man I'd later know to be Mohammad Ashadul, I called in at the farm for the first time in a while. In truth it hadn't been so long, maybe only four or five days, but it felt like a month. As I drove down the track towards it, it seemed as though I was revisiting a scene from a past life, a place I'd once known but had left behind. The vines hung lower from the trees than I remembered, the _lalang_ had grown so thick and tall that it was spilling from the verges and narrowing the lane to half its former width. We'd planted it just six months before, to hold the banks of earth in place and stop landslides in the rainy season, but it had grown thick and lush in that time. We were meaning to cut it the previous week, before the men fell sick; now it no longer resembled long grass but the folds of waves on a bright-green sea.\n\nThere must have been strong winds in the night, because the parking area was strewn with broken branches and fresh leaves ripped from the trees. Jezmine's car was in the yard, but I could tell at once that things weren't right \u2013 the hum of the engines that ran the pumps was lower and rougher than usual. In the distance, the neat squares of the ponds looked calm and silvery, but that too was a bad sign. The stillness of the water bothered me; everything else in the world seemed to be shifting.\n\nJezmine came out of the office to meet me. Mr Lai had called several times, and on each occasion she'd said that everything was under control. What did he expect would happen? A tsunami in the Straits of Melaka or something? Stop being so paranoid. Everything's fine.\n\nI could just imagine their conversation. I'd heard her speak on the phone hundreds of times. She could put anyone in their place, make men like Mr Lai feel like primary school boys with her directness and flat tone of voice, as if she was slightly bored and waiting for them to keep up with her. Her lies had bought us an extra day or two \u2013 Mr Lai had decided he wouldn't rush home from Penang, that he'd stay another couple of days, take it easy, go out for a few meals with his wife. Good idea, Jezmine had said.\n\n'Do you smell that?' I said. We were standing in the yard, neither of us daring to ask the next question: What do we do now?\n\n'Smell what?'\n\nWe started walking towards the ponds, and had just reached the first of the enclosures when I figured out the source of the sharp, sour odour hanging in the air, growing stronger all the time. Ammonium and decaying flesh.\n\n'Ugh.' Jezmine had her hand over her nose.\n\nAt the halfway point on the wooden walkway, I began to notice that the pumps at the far end of the farm weren't working. Fish had gathered close to the surface, sometimes breaking the water with a flash of their tails. As we walked along, it occurred to me that most people wouldn't have sensed the panic around us. If you were an outsider, someone unconnected to our farm, you wouldn't have seen anything but still, green-grey water, the darting of fish. You wouldn't have sensed the disturbance below the surface, the agitation of the fish, the way some were swimming frantically in tight circles, others drifting so slowly they seemed suspended in the water, as lifeless as a painting. Without the soft jets of water from the pumps, you would have remarked upon the flatness of the water, so natural and peaceful. We, Jezmine and I, saw only the stagnation that preceded death. Where you saw calm, we saw chaos. You saw the beautiful order of things, we saw decay.\n\nI knew that many of the fish would have been suffocating, that they weren't getting enough fresh moving water, that their feeding had been interrupted. Maybe something had got into the water, some chemicals from up the coast. We didn't need to walk all the way to the furthest ponds to see the damage, but we did anyway, staring at the silvery carpet of fish, the sun glinting on the scales of their upturned bellies. The wind had died, and if no one had told you that you were looking at dead fish, you could easily have thought it was a trick of the light caused by the sea and the small shifts in the cloud that change the way the world appears. But the stench made the truth clear; the acidic chemical smell burned the insides of our nostrils and made us choke.\n\nJezmine was still covering her mouth and nose with her hand. She muttered something, almost a whisper. _Cham lor_. She might have said the same thing when she couldn't find a parking space in town on a busy Saturday afternoon, or if she was late in paying her mobile phone bill, or realised she'd forgotten her purse \u2013 the minor incidents of modern daily life. But in this instance it seemed particularly apt. Just one hushed little observation. We were screwed.\n\nBy the time we reached the office it was clear that even Jezmine couldn't think of a solution. 'What are you going to tell Mr Lai?' she asked. 'Maybe you can just blame it on the men. Say they all disappeared without warning, tell him the truth.'\n\nI shook my head. I was still trying to figure out how much money we would lose with two ponds full of dead fish, trying to equate each carcass to a sum of money. If we could get some new workers, cheaper ones, how quickly could we make the money back? It wasn't as though we paid the Indonesians a lot anyway, but from what Keong and Uzzal had told me about the others, I was sure we could pay them even less, to start with anyway. When someone is desperate for work, they're not going to ask for permits and insurance. They wouldn't even know about that sort of thing. I couldn't work out exactly how much we'd save, but surely quite a lot over the long run. If I could have them in place in the next couple of days, working hard by the time Mr Lai returned, it would soften the blow of losing so much money. I knew what he was like. He wouldn't care about losing the workers, he'd only care about what that would mean for his profits. It didn't make any difference who worked for him. As long as they kept his business running smoothly, he didn't mind. All those years, he barely knew the workers' names. Maybe he wouldn't even notice that I'd taken on completely new people.\n\n'I have some men lined up,' I said. 'Almost ready to work. Tomorrow or the day after.' In my head, I was convinced this was true. All the rules and routines I'd known up to that moment had changed, the world I inhabited no longer seemed to belong to me, and in this new land, whole groups of men and women could disappear from their homes and appear in an entirely foreign country without knowing where they were, or how exactly they got there. They could be alive one minute, dead the next, just from the same water they'd been drinking for months.\n\nThe normal order of life no longer applied. When you leave your old home you're a child; when you reach your new one, you're an adult. You don't even know how it happened. You get a job. You get sick. You get married. You get high. You get sacked. You get a break. You get screwed. You get nothing. You get everything. There was no longer any logic in this world; things happened in random order. I couldn't figure out how one event led to another, so why was it so ridiculous to think that by the next day I would have found twelve new workers? I'd lost the old ones without any warning, I'd get new ones just as quickly.\n\n'You kidding?'\n\nI shook my head. 'I have a meeting with someone tonight. Tomorrow, we'll have the workers.'\n\nEven in the messy sequence of my thinking, I knew that failure was a far greater possibility than success. But in spite of this \u2013 or perhaps precisely because of it \u2013 I felt free to imagine what would happen if I did succeed in finding new workers that evening. They'd arrive the following day, tired and maybe a bit sick. I'd feed them, buy them new clothes, make them shower and get clean. I'd give them a bit of cash from my own pocket to show them we were serious employers, maybe give them half a day's rest. By the next day they'd be fully at work, and by the time Mr Lai got back it would seem as though nothing had changed.\n\nWhen I met Keong at the layby that night the darkness meant that I couldn't make out the expression on his face \u2013 couldn't tell if he was nervous or scared or angry.\n\n'You eaten yet?' he asked. Even though it was a standard greeting, I found it odd that he'd say it at that particular moment. It was way past dinner time, nearly ten o'clock, so of course I'd eaten. I was waiting for him to tell me about how he'd got in touch with Ashadul \u2013 what they'd discussed on the phone, what they'd agreed \u2013 but instead he started describing what he'd had for dinner. He'd been very hungry, he said, he hadn't had lunch, or very little, too early in the day, so at about six o'clock he'd gone to a seafood place and ordered enough food for a whole family. He had steamed prawns, a kilo of crab, some Marmite ribs, a big bowl of soup. He didn't know why he was so hungry, but he couldn't stop eating \u2013 it felt like he hadn't eaten in days, and had never tasted food so good. Everything seemed so new and delicious, and of course all that food had made him thirsty. Maybe they used _ajinomoto_ in the cooking to make it tastier, and those sorts of chemicals always made his throat dry, so he'd washed it down with three big bottles of beer. He was thinking, This might be a long night, better eat well.\n\n'Why a long night? We're just going to talk to the guy, right? Confirm what time he'll deliver the workers. We don't need all night for that.'\n\nKeong shrugged. 'You never know with these people. He said he'd call me when he's ready, but the bastard hasn't called.' He checked his phone, its green glow making his face look shapeless and flat, but I still couldn't make out his expression. When the light went out and his face blended into the darkness again, he said, 'Want a drink?' He went around to the passenger seat and reached into the glovebox. He handed me a plastic cup and unscrewed a bottle. When he poured from it into my cup I could smell the strong, sweet odour of XO cognac. 'I don't have any Coca-Cola to mix it with,' he said. 'It's OK just as it is.'\n\nWe leaned against the bonnet, staring at the headlamps of the cars going past in the distance. At this time of night there was hardly any traffic, and I started to count the seconds between each car. Five, nine, twelve.\n\n'What did you say when you called him earlier?' I asked. 'Does he have the men?'\n\n' _Aiya_ ,' he laughed. 'You're always worried. Relax. It'll be fine. He's got the men, we just need to agree the price.'\n\nWe had another drink while Keong checked his phone. He dialled a number, and I could hear the ringtone clearly, even though I was standing a good few feet from him. I can remember how still it was that night \u2013 I remember the total absence of wind, because I could hear each long beep of the ringtone as clearly as if someone was shaking a bell in my ear.\n\n'I'm feeling sleepy,' Keong said. He reached into his pocket and produced a small plastic bag, the kind with a Ziploc top. He held it up against the night sky, but I couldn't see its contents. He emptied it into the palm of his hand, and manoeuvred his phone to shine a light on the small pills that lay there. I noticed how worn and creased his hands were \u2013 rough hands that seemed to belong to a much older man. 'Take one,' he said. 'It'll make sure you're wide awake.'\n\n'I'm not tired,' I lied. It felt as though the previous fifteen years had disappeared, collapsed into another realm, and that we were acting out one of our Friday nights in KL, when we were barely out of our teens and trying to get started in life. The cheap pills of dubious quality, the long nights \u2013 the rituals of our youth. I took one, without knowing what it was, and without believing it would really help me stay awake and alert, and in the minutes and hours that followed, I can't honestly say that my mental state was affected, in a good way or a bad way. That was something else I remember from the trial: my lawyer trying to argue that I'd acted under the influence of drugs, even though I'd told her the pill had made no difference to my behaviour. Four, maybe five cups of XO, one amphetamine tablet, or something similar \u2013 it would have changed nothing. In the end, her defence failed, the jury didn't consider the alcohol and the drugs to be _relevant factors._ And neither do I. Looking back at that evening, as I've done many times in the years since, I agree with them.\n\nKeong's phone rang, and I could hear a man's voice on the other end. Keong grunted a single syllable in agreement, and put his phone away. He threw his cup into the long grass and said, 'We'll take my car.' When we were inside he reached under his seat and pulled out a long, thin object wrapped in a cloth. He handed it to me and said, 'Hang on to this. Just in case.'\n\n'You're fucking kidding me,' I said. I didn't have to undo his little parcel to know that it was a knife. 'We're just going to have a talk. Why would we need that?'\n\n'Like I said, you never know with these guys.'\n\n'You take it,' I said. 'I'm not touching it.'\n\n'Suit yourself.'\n\nIt didn't take us long to drive back into town. At that time the traffic is always light, but that night it seemed quieter than usual. Who knows \u2013 maybe the port business was slow, and fewer container ships were docking, so all the lorries ferrying goods up to KL had called it quits. Sometimes work at the port slowed down and you'd see migrants drifting into town looking for a few days' casual work here and there, from whoever would employ them. During these periods the town appeared to function normally, which is to say that a visitor like you wouldn't notice anything unusual. You'd see the buses and the markets, shopkeepers sweeping the pavements outside their doors, people sitting down at roadside food stalls \u2013 but you'd miss the feeling of anxiety, the knowledge that the entire town depended on trade from faraway places, goods being bought and sold by people we would never know. Some politician in America decides that they can't buy Malaysian rubber gloves; suddenly ten factories in the area have to shut down. The Europeans want to save the fucking planet so they ban the use of palm oil in food; within a month the entire port is on its knees. Life continues, but you feel it slipping quietly away, and you worry that it'll never return. And because of that fear, you feel caught in a suspended state. On the outside, life seems normal, but inside it's drawn to a standstill.\n\nThat night, driving into town, I felt the same sense of being lost, as if events were being controlled by things and people I didn't know, far away from me. We drew in to a parking spot near some abandoned houses, not far from the riverbank. Keong led the way, picking a path through trees until we were walking along a rough track that led closer to the river's edge. There wasn't enough light in the night sky to see clearly, and I had to hold up my phone and point its faint glow towards the ground so I didn't trip up. Keong was walking quickly, without any hesitation, and I got the impression he'd been there before, walking this exact route.\n\n'Turn off your phone,' he said. I stumbled a few times in the dark, unable to keep up with him. Later, after the killing, when I retraced my steps, I'd find myself thinking how clear the path was, how light the landscape, even though it was the middle of the night. But in those first few minutes I couldn't even see my feet. All I could hear was the sound of Keong marching steadily through the long grass, the ground getting slightly swampy underfoot.\n\nI started to fall behind, and after a while he was so far ahead of me that I couldn't make him out. When I caught up with him, under a large spreading tree, he was already talking loudly. I'd heard his voice from a long way off, agitated from the start. Now he was shouting. _What the hell, money doesn't mean anything to you any more? I'll chop your stupid head off._ The other man didn't answer. In the dark, the tip of his cigarette glowed deep red, then faded again. Keong continued to talk in his machine-gun way, the words tumbling out in long jagged streams. He was waving his arms, occasionally pointing his finger at the man's face, and as I drew closer he glanced at me. Suddenly I could see his face, as if the clouds had cleared to reveal the moon, and in those moments every detail of the land seems sharper than at midday, every blade of grass and curve of a leaf becomes highlighted by the moonlight. Only there was no moon that night \u2013 I'd only realise that later on.\n\nI don't know how I started to notice shapes and textures at that point in time, when only a few minutes previously everything had been obscured by darkness. Keong's face was twisted in rage, deep lines scarring the skin around his mouth and eyes. How he'd aged. I heard every sound, too \u2013 the way both of them breathed. Keong's short, heavy breaths, drawn sharply at the end of sentences, three, four quick breaths after he cursed. Ashadul's slow, rasping breaths, his lungs and throat coated in tar and phlegm. A smoker's cough rising from his chest. The flat tone of his voice contrasting to Keong's hysterics. The clarity of it all.\n\nWho's this?\n\nMy cousin. Why you care?\n\nThe man turns to me. Then he laughs \u2013 laughter so rich that for a moment I feel this is all a joke, and we're friends.\n\n_Brother_ , he says, looking at me. _You come to threaten me is it?_\n\nAnd then: Keong cursing in Cantonese. (What's the point, I remember thinking, the guy can't speak Cantonese.) _Lia ma,_ _I chop you dead. You owe me money still don't pay._\n\nThe man laughing. Standing firm, unmoving as Keong comes right up close to him. _Not scared ah I can kill you right here no one will care my brother will fuck up your family screw you for seven generations._ Still in Cantonese.\n\nWhy?\n\nCigarette smoke, like a puff of bird feathers in the dark. Then a quick movement, a scuffle, and Keong has pulled out the knife. _Chop your head see if you still laugh_. But Ashadul stands as motionless as the trees around him, and I know he isn't going to budge. I know it's Keong who's going to lose this fight.\n\n_Give me my money and we let you go_ , Keong says.\n\n(We. He says _we_.)\n\nHe makes a swift lunge towards Ashadul, and suddenly Ashadul is on the ground. They're both on the ground. I back away, I need to get out of there, but I stumble backwards, I trip over a pile of logs, a branch. Keong's knife has fallen to the ground, lost in the undergrowth. Ashadul is first to his feet. He faces me, and waits for a second or two before taking a knife out of his pocket. The blade makes a sharp, clean noise as it flicks open, as if claiming its place in the night. He walks over to Keong, and I don't know what he's going to do. I can't see Keong's face, but I can still hear his breaths, quick, desperate. As if he can't breathe. Ashadul stands over him, looking as if he's examining the knife, considering his options. I hear Keong's voice.\n\n_Ah Hock_.\n\nI struggle to stand up. I put my hand on the branch next to me, but as I lean on it to rise to my feet it breaks and I fall again, the piece of wood useless in my hand. Ashadul laughs and turns back towards Keong.\n\nI don't know how I manage to stand up, but I do. I get to my feet, and in just three or four steps I've reached Ashadul. I know he can't see me as I raise my arm. I think: This is stupid, I'm not strong enough to hurt him, he's going to kill me. I'll hit him, but not hard enough to knock him out, and then he'll kill me. The first blow catches him squarely on the back of the head, and he falls straight to the ground. As I watch his body collapse slowly, I think: He's a heavy man. He tries to get up, but I'm already raising my arm to strike him a second time. And a third. And it continues. I aim each blow at his head. At first he tries to move his head, to shield himself with his arms, but soon he's motionless. I continue to hit him. I don't know how many times.\n\nLater, when my case was in court, I heard that the autopsy showed I'd hit him fourteen times. The number didn't hold any meaning for me. It was the same as if they'd told me it was a hundred, or a thousand times. I remember raising my arm time and time again until it felt like the only thing my arm was capable of doing, that it had been created for that purpose and nothing else.\n\nAfter I'd stopped, I looked at Keong. Now I could see his expression \u2013 pale and wide-eyed. _We were just meant to scare him. We didn't mean to harm him. That's why I asked Ah Hock to come with me_. I remember the things Keong said during the trial, when he appeared as a witness for the defence. _I wanted the Bangladeshi to pay back the money he owed me, that's all. Two against one works better. He'd be frightened, he'd pay. It was simple. We didn't mean anything more than that._\n\nKeong lay on the ground for some time, staring at me as if I was someone he'd never seen in his life. He didn't blink, didn't speak, and for a moment I thought that maybe he'd been fatally wounded, that Ashadul had stabbed him without me seeing it. I even thought he might already be dead. The human body is capable of all sorts of incredible things beyond the control of its own muscles. We are after all creatures of nature. Chop off the head of a snake and it'll still bite you, still be capable of injecting poison into your flesh, only it's even worse than a live snake because the poison glands don't know when to stop. Sometimes people are dead but they sit up and look at you with open eyes as if they're still alive. I felt that Keong \u2013 the dying or already dead Keong \u2013 was asking me a question without speaking \u2013 the way people sometimes do when they can't understand why you've behaved in a way that seems so extreme to them, so bizarre and inexplicable, they can't even bring themselves to ask _Why?_\n\nJenny used to do that often, like the time she found I'd kept a whole drawer full of used toothbrushes. I kept them because I hated throwing them out, and thought I could re-use them in some other way, like cleaning shoes or bottles, but mostly because I hated the idea of throwing out something that hadn't broken, something I'd paid money for. She held them in a big bunch in her fist, and when she looked at me she didn't need to say anything. Why the hell have you done this? Why are you so strange? There was no need to ask, because there was no explanation for my behaviour. In any case, she'd already supplied her own answer, and anything I said would have been superfluous. That was how it was with Keong and me at that moment. It was pointless for either of us to say anything.\n\nAfter a while, when I was almost fully convinced that he was dead, he got to his feet and scrambled up the bank, through the trees and undergrowth, in the direction of the road. From the crashing and tearing of the foliage I knew he was running blindly, as fast as he could. He didn't turn back to look at me. That was the last time I saw him before the trial.\n\nWhen I could no longer hear Keong I knew I was alone on the riverbank, and that I was very thirsty. So thirsty I found it difficult to breathe. I swallowed a few times, but my throat felt as rough as sandpaper. My legs began to buckle, and I had to sit down. I realised that I was next to the dead man, so close that his outstretched hand was almost touching me. Mohammad Ashadul. Maybe if I'd known his name at that moment I might have felt more afraid \u2013 more anguished about what I'd done, more terrified by what was to come, the life that would follow. Instead, all I felt was an aching in my limbs so intense that I thought for a while I might pass out.\n\nI lay down next to him. Two bodies, side by side in the darkness. In the way that human beings do, by pure instinct, I listened for his breathing, as if we had both lain down to sleep.\n\n##\n\nThe drive is longer than I expected. It's a Saturday afternoon, so even the highways that snake around KL are clogged. I've never driven out of this side of town, heading into the hills towards Genting. We reach the final toll plaza, and the cars are backed up for three or four hundred yards waiting to get through. The air-con is blowing in my face, and I'm glad I'm not driving.\n\nWe'll be OK once we get through this bit, she says.\n\nSure enough, the traffic clears once we pass the toll booth and the road begins to climb.\n\nIt'll be fine, she says. You'll love it.\n\nI didn't reply to the invitation when it arrived by email. It wasn't addressed to me alone, but to a whole bunch of people, and it came from someone I didn't know \u2013 someone from her publisher, I later found out, which was throwing a party to mark the publication of the book. Yes, _your_ story, she said when she rang me to ask why I hadn't responded to the email.\n\nThat's nonsense. It's your book, not mine.\n\nBut it's _your_ story. You have to come! I'll collect you and we'll drive up there together. I won't take no for an answer!\n\nWe pass a guardhouse manned by Nepalese men who tick our names off a list and let us through. Although we're driving slowly through jungle the roads are immaculate, and now and then a mansion rises out of the trees. I see people sitting on balconies overlooking the forested valley beyond. Eventually we drive into a sort of farm \u2013 not the kind I used to know as a child, but a place with neatly manicured squares of vegetables dotted with papaya trees. A sign at the entrance announces that it's an organic farm, and there are a few Indonesian workers still out in the fields, even though it's late in the afternoon. A passionfruit vine hangs over the space where we park the car.\n\nWe seem to be the last people to arrive, and a cheer goes up when we walk into the room, which is in a large wooden house on stilts overlooking a lotus pond. There are no walls, and a breeze rises up and blows a stack of paper napkins all over the floor. Most people are drinking wine or champagne. Someone offers me a glass. I decline.\n\nOh, you don't drink? That's cool, the young man says. He has long hair tied in a ponytail, and his skin is as clear as candle wax. I'll get you some juice. Pineapple OK?\n\nMost people are speaking English; some of them sound American to me. But they're all locals, all her friends. After a few minutes someone makes a speech, describing the novel. I guess he's the editor. He's speaking too fast; I can't hear him properly, and suddenly I realise I can't really understand anything he's saying. At one point during the speech everyone turns to look at me, smiling, but I don't know why. There's applause, and Su-Min turns to look at me. She says something that makes everyone laugh, but by now I can't understand what anyone is saying. When she finishes, everyone applauds, and people drift away. Some of them wander over to the buffet table, others hang over the edge of the banisters, smoking and laughing. I wait a while, wondering if she'll come and speak to me, but I can see that she's deep in conversation with a group of people, including her editor. Very discreetly, I move away, walk down the path to the far end of the pond, and sit under a rambutan tree.\n\nFrom where I'm sitting I have a view of the party, but no one can see me. The light is just starting to fade, and further up the hill some kerosene lamps appear, like fireflies in the jungle. That must be where the workers live. Although lots of people are laughing, I can hear her laughter in particular, rising above the others'. I look up and see her talking to a woman about her age. They talk together, just the two of them, for a long time.\n\nCircles ripple gently across the surface of the pond, and I know there are tilapia in it, even though I can't see them in this light. There's a small pump at one side of the pond, next to a clump of banana trees, and all of a sudden I think I'm hallucinating. In fact I know I'm hallucinating, but it feels real anyway. I see my mother, squatting by the edge of the pond, wiping her brow with the small towel that hangs around her neck as she hacks away at some weeds that are growing into the water. She's weaker now than before, and her arm rises and falls slowly. From time to time her hearing aid squeals, and I call out to her. Ma, enough, go back inside and relax, but of course she can't hear me.\n\nHey. What are you doing out here all on your own? You escaped the party.\n\nA bit noisy in there. I needed some fresh air.\n\nYeah, lots of people came. Everyone's fascinated by your story.\n\nI think they're more interested in your book.\n\nSame thing, isn't it?\n\nIs that her? The one you were talking to. Your partner. Alex, isn't it?\n\nMy ex-partner, yes.\n\nYou look good together. You seemed to be getting along well.\n\nYou think? She laughs. Well, a bit late for that now.\n\nNothing's too late. If you still love each other, why not give it another go?\n\nLet's see. Anyway, what about you? Why don't I introduce you to some of the people here? You never know, you might meet someone.\n\nGood idea. Convicted murderers are always so popular.\n\nIt wasn't _murder._ She laughs. The same laugh I've heard all evening, drifting across the farm, mingling with the sound of the water. I could marry you if you want. A militant queer girl and a depressed felon \u2013 a perfect match.\n\nThat's not even funny, I say, but I'm laughing. We both are. The moment lasts just a few seconds, but seems to stretch into the night.\n\nI think I'm going to go now, I say.\n\nNo, please stay! There's lots more food, lots to drink.\n\nI'm tired, I'll just go home.\n\nThat's crazy. Give me a few minutes to say hi and bye to some people and I'll drive you.\n\nNo, no, please. Just enjoy yourself. I checked the bus timetable, there's one every hour from the village nearby. She knows I'm lying, but she decides not to argue.\n\nAre you sure?\n\nReally, I'm sure. I'd feel bad if you left your party now. You worked hard for it, you should enjoy it. I'm tired. I need to move my legs, otherwise my back will seize up.\n\nOK. But call me if you need help. I'll keep my phone on.\n\nWe stand facing each other. It's almost completely dark now. I think that maybe I should extend my hand, but that feels wrong, and she doesn't move either.\n\nGoodbye, I say.\n\nThe walk down the hill takes nearly an hour, and by the time I get to the village all the shops are closed. I sit on the concrete steps of a coffee shop, listening to the noise of the traffic from the highway nearby. The rush of the cars and lorries sounds fuzzy and soothing, like the sea on a windy day.\n\n### About the Author\n\nTash Aw was born in Taipei to Malaysian parents.

The small-scale CMB lensing fluctuations receive non-negligible contributions from nonlinear structure in the late-time density field. These fluctuations are not fully characterized by traditional two-point statistics, such as the power spectrum. Here, we use $N$-body ray-tracing simulations of CMB lensing maps to examine two higher-order statistics: the lensing convergence one-point probability distribution function (PDF) and peak counts. We show that these statistics contain significant information not captured by the two-point function, and provide specific forecasts for the ongoing Stage-III Advanced Atacama Cosmology Telescope (AdvACT) experiment. Considering only the temperature-based reconstruction estimator, we forecast 9$\\sigma$ (PDF) and 6$\\sigma$ (peaks) detections of these statistics with AdvACT. Our simulation pipeline fully accounts for the non-Gaussianity of the lensing reconstruction noise, which is significant and cannot be neglected. Combining the power spectrum, PDF, and peak counts for AdvACT will tighten cosmological constraints in the $\\Omega_m$-$\\sigma_8$ plane by $\\approx 30\\%$, compared to using the power spectrum alone.'\nauthor:\n- 'Jia Liu$^{1,2}$'\n- 'J.

On their way to the Earth, CMB photons emitted at redshift $z=1100$ are deflected by the intervening matter, producing new correlations in maps of CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies. Estimators based on these correlations can be applied to the observed anisotropy maps to reconstruct a noisy estimate of the CMB lensing potential\u00a0[@Zaldarriaga1998; @Zaldarriaga1999; @HuOkamoto2002; @Okamoto2003]. CMB lensing can probe fundamental physical quantities, such as the dark energy equation of state and neutrino masses, through its sensitivity to the geometry of the universe and the growth of structure (see Refs.\u00a0[@Lewis2006; @Hanson2010] for a review).\n\nIn this paper, we study the non-Gaussian information stored in CMB lensing observations. The Gaussian approximation to the density field breaks down due to nonlinear evolution on small scales at late times. Thus, non-Gaussian statistics (i.e., statistics beyond the power spectrum) are necessary to capture the full information in the density field. Such work has been previously performed (theoretically and observationally) on weak gravitational lensing of galaxies, where galaxy shapes, instead of CMB temperature/polarization patterns, are distorted (hereafter \u201cgalaxy lensing\u201d). Several research groups have found independently that non-Gaussian statistics can tighten cosmological constraints when they are combined with the two-point correlation function or angular power spectrum.[^1] Such non-Gaussian statistics have also been applied in the CMB context to the Sunyaev-Zel\u2019dovich signal, including higher-order moments\u00a0[@Wilson2012; @Hill2013; @Planck2013tSZ; @Planck2015tSZ], the bispectrum\u00a0[@Bhattacharya2012; @Crawford2014; @Planck2013tSZ; @Planck2015tSZ], and the one-point probability distribution function (PDF)\u00a0[@Hill2014b; @Planck2013tSZ; @Planck2015tSZ]. In all cases, substantial non-Gaussian information was found, yielding improved cosmological constraints.\n\nThe motivation to study non-Gaussian statistics of CMB lensing maps is three-fold. First, the CMB lensing kernel is sensitive to structures at high redshift ($z\\approx2.0$, compared to $z\\approx0.4$ for typical galaxy lensing samples); hence CMB lensing non-Gaussian statistics probe early nonlinearity that is beyond the reach of galaxy surveys. Second, CMB lensing does not suffer from some challenging systematics that are relevant to galaxy lensing, including intrinsic alignments of galaxies, photometric redshift uncertainties, and shape measurement biases. Therefore, a combined analysis of galaxy lensing and CMB lensing will be useful to build a tomographic outlook on nonlinear structure evolution, as well as to calibrate systematics in both galaxy and CMB lensing surveys\u00a0[@Liu2016; @Baxter2016; @Schaan2016; @Singh2016; @Nicola2016]. Finally, CMB lensing measurements have recently entered a regime of sufficient sensitivity and resolution to detect the (stacked) lensing signals of halos\u00a0[@Madhavacheril2014; @Baxter2016; @Planck2015cluster]. This suggests that statistics sensitive to the nonlinear growth of structure, i.e., non-Gaussian statistics, will also soon be detectable. We demonstrate below that this is indeed the case, taking as a reference experiment the ongoing Advanced Atacama Cosmology Telescope (AdvACT) survey\u00a0[@Henderson2016].\n\nNon-Gaussian aspects of the CMB lensing field have recently attracted attention, both as a potential signal and a source of bias in CMB lensing power spectrum estimates. Considering the lensing non-Gaussianity as a signal, a recent analytical study of the CMB lensing bispectrum by Ref.\u00a0[@Namikawa2016] forecasted its detectability to be 40$\\sigma$ with a CMB Stage-IV experiment. Ref.\u00a0[@Bohm2016] performed the first calculation of the bias induced in CMB lensing power spectrum estimates by the lensing bispectrum, finding non-negligible biases for Stage-III and IV CMB experiments. Refs.\u00a0[@Pratten2016] and\u00a0[@Marozzi2016] considered CMB lensing effects arising from the breakdown of the Born approximation, with the former study finding that post-Born terms substantially alter the predicted CMB lensing bispectrum, compared to the contributions from nonlinear structure formation alone. We emphasize that the $N$-body ray-tracing simulations used in this work naturally capture such effects \u2014 we do not use the Born approximation. However, we consider only the lensing potential $\\phi$ or convergence $\\kappa$ here (related by $\\kappa = -\\nabla^2 \\phi/2$), leaving a treatment of the curl potential or image rotation for future work (Ref.\u00a0[@Pratten2016] has demonstrated that the curl potential possesses non-trivial higher-order statistics). In a follow-up paper, the simulations described here are used to more precisely characterize CMB lensing power spectrum biases arising from the bispectrum and higher-order correlations [@Sherwin2016].\n\nWe consider the non-Gaussianity in the CMB lensing field as a potential signal. We use a suite of 46 $N$-body ray-tracing simulations to investigate two non-Gaussian statistics applied to CMB lensing convergence maps \u2014 the one-point PDF and peak counts. We examine the deviation of the convergence PDF and peak counts from those of Gaussian random fields. We then quantify the power of these statistics to constrain cosmological models, compared with using the power spectrum alone.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. We first introduce CMB lensing in Sec.\u00a0\\[sec:formalism\\]. We then describe our simulation pipeline in Sec.\u00a0\\[sec:sim\\] and analysis procedures in Sec.\u00a0\\[sec:analysis\\]. We show our results for the power spectrum, PDF, peak counts, and the derived cosmological constraints in Sec.\u00a0\\[sec:results\\]. We conclude in Sec.\u00a0\\[sec:conclude\\].\n\nCMB lensing formalism {#sec:formalism}\n=====================\n\nTo lowest order, the lensing convergence ($\\kappa$) is a weighted projection of the three-dimensional matter overdensity $\\delta=\\delta\\rho/\\bar{\\rho}$ along the line of sight,\n\n$$\\label{eq.kappadef}\n\\kappa(\\thetaB) = \\int_0^{\\infty} dz W(z) \\delta(\\chi(z)\\thetaB, z),$$\n\nwhere $\\chi(z)$ is the comoving distance and the kernel $W(z)$ indicates the lensing strength at redshift $z$ for sources with a redshift distribution $p(z_s)=dn(z_s)/dz$. For CMB lensing, there is only one source plane at the last scattering surface $z_\\star=1100$; therefore, $p(z_s)=\\delta_D(z_s-z_\\star)$, where $\\delta_D$ is the Dirac delta function. For a flat universe, the CMB lensing kernel is\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nW^{{\\kappa_{\\rm cmb}}}(z) &=&  \\frac{3}{2}\\Omega_{m}H_0^2  \\frac{(1+z)}{H(z)} \\frac{\\chi(z)}{c} \\nonumber\\\\ \n&\\times&  \\frac{\\chi(z_\\star)-\\chi(z)}{\\chi(z_\\star)}.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nwhere $\\Omega_{m}$ is the matter density as a fraction of the critical density at $z=0$, $H(z)$ is the Hubble parameter at redshift $z$, with a present-day value $H_0$, and $c$ is the speed of light. $W^{{\\kappa_{\\rm cmb}}}(z)$ peaks at $z\\approx2$ for canonical cosmological parameters ($\\Omega_{m}\\approx0.3$ and $H_0\\approx70$ km/s/Mpc,\u00a0[@planck2015xiii]). Note that Eq.\u00a0(\\[eq.kappadef\\]) assumes the Born approximation, but our simulation approach described below does not \u2014 we implement full ray-tracing to calculate $\\kappa$.\n\nSimulations {#sec:sim}\n===========\n\nOur simulation procedure includes five main steps: (1) the design (parameter sampling) of cosmological models, (2) $N$-body simulations with Gadget-2,[^2] (3) ray-tracing from $z=0$ to $z=1100$ to obtain (noiseless) convergence maps using the Python code LensTools\u00a0[@Petri2016],[^3] (4) lensing simulated CMB temperature maps by the ray-traced convergence field, and (5) reconstructing (noisy) convergence maps from the CMB temperature maps after including noise and beam effects.\n\nSimulation design\n-----------------\n\nWe use an irregular grid to sample parameters in the $\\Omega_m$-$\\sigma_8$ plane, within the range of $\\Omega_m \\in [0.15, 0.7]$ and $\\sigma_8 \\in [0.5, 1.0]$, where $\\sigma_8$ is the rms amplitude of linear density fluctuations on a scale of 8 Mpc/$h$ at $z=0$. An optimized irregular grid has a smaller average distance between neighboring points than a regular grid, and no parameters are duplicated. Hence, it samples the parameter space more efficiently. The procedure to optimize our sampling is described in detail in Ref.\u00a0[@Petri2015].\n\nThe 46 cosmological models sampled are shown in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:design\\]. Other cosmological parameters are held fixed, with $H_0=72$ km/s/Mpc, dark energy equation of state $w=-1$, spectral index $n_s=0.96$, and baryon density $\\Omega_b=0.046$. The design can be improved in the future by posterior sampling, where we first run only a few models to generate a low-resolution probability plane, and then sample more densely in the high-probability region.\n\nWe select the model that is closest to the standard concordance values of the cosmological parameters (e.g.,\u00a0[@planck2015xiii]) as our fiducial model, with $\\Omega_m=0.296$ and $\\sigma_8=0.786$. We create two sets of realizations for this model, one for covariance matrix estimation, and another one for parameter interpolation. This fiducial model is circled in red in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:design\\].\n\n![\\[fig:design\\] The design of cosmological parameters used in our simulations (46 models in total). The fiducial cosmology ($\\Omega_m=0.296, \\sigma_8=0.786$) is circled in red. The models for which AdvACT-like lensing reconstruction is performed are circled in blue. Other cosmological parameters are fixed at $H_0=72$ km/s/Mpc, $w=-1$, $n_s=0.96$, and $\\Omega_b=0.046$.](plot/plot_design.pdf){width=\"48.00000%\"}\n\n$N$-body simulation and ray-tracing {#sec:nbody}\n-----------------------------------\n\nWe use the public code Gadget-2 to run $N$-body simulations with $N_{\\rm particles}=1024^3$ and box size = 600 Mpc/$h$ (corresponding to a mass resolution of $1.4\\times10^{10} M_\\odot/h$). To initialize each simulation, we first obtain the linear matter power spectrum with the Einstein-Boltzmann code CAMB.[^4] The power spectrum is then fed into the initial condition generator N-GenIC, which generates initial snapshots (the input of Gadget-2) of particle positions at $z=100$. The $N$-body simulation is then run from $z=100$ to $z=0$, and we record snapshots at every 144 Mpc$/h$ in comoving distance between $z\\approx45$ and $z=0$. The choice of $z\\approx45$ is determined by requiring that the redshift range covers 99% of the $W^{\\kappa_{cmb}}D(z)$ kernel, where we use the linear growth factor $D(z)\\sim 1/(1+z)$.\n\nWe then use the Python code LensTools\u00a0[@Petri2016] to generate CMB lensing convergence maps. We first slice the simulation boxes to create potential planes (3 planes per box, 200 Mpc/$h$ in thickness), where particle density is converted into gravitational potential using the Poisson equation. We track the trajectories of 4096$^2$ light rays from $z=0$ to $z=1100$, where the deflection angle and convergence are calculated at each potential plane. This procedure automatically captures so-called \u201cpost-Born\u201d effects, as we never assume that the deflection angle is small or that the light rays follow unperturbed geodesics.[^5] Finally, we create 1,000 convergence map realizations for each cosmology by randomly rotating/shifting the potential planes\u00a0[@Petri2016b]. For the fiducial cosmology only, we generate 10,000 realizations for the purpose of estimating the covariance matrix. The convergence maps are 2048$^2$ pixels and 12.25 deg$^2$ in size, with square pixels of side length 0.1025 arcmin. The maps generated at this step correspond to the physical lensing convergence field only, i.e., they have no noise from CMB lensing reconstruction. Therefore, they are labeled as \u201cnoiseless\u201d in the following sections and figures.\n\n![\\[fig:theory\\_ps\\] Comparison of the CMB lensing convergence power spectrum from the HaloFit model and that from our simulation (1024$^3$ particles, box size 600 Mpc/$h$, map size 12.25 deg$^2$), for our fiducial cosmology. We also show the prediction from linear theory. Error bars are the standard deviation of 10,000 realizations.](plot/plot_theory_comparison.pdf){width=\"48.00000%\"}\n\nWe test the power spectra from our simulated maps against standard theoretical predictions. Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:theory\\_ps\\] shows the power spectrum from our simulated maps versus that from the HaloFit model\u00a0[@Smith2003; @Takahashi2012] for our fiducial cosmology. We also show the linear-theory prediction, which deviates from the nonlinear HaloFit result at $\\ell \\gtrsim 700$. The simulation error bars are estimated using the standard deviation of 10,000 realizations. The simulated and (nonlinear) theoretical results are consistent within the error bars for multipoles $\\ell<2,000$, which is sufficient for this work, as current and near-future CMB lensing surveys are limited to roughly this $\\ell$ range due to their beam size and noise level (the filtering applied in our analysis below effectively removes all information on smaller angular scales). We find similar consistency between theory and simulation for the other 45 simulated models. We test the impact of particle resolution using a smaller box of 300 Mpc/$h$, while keeping the same number of particles (i.e. 8 times higher resolution), and obtain excellent agreement at scales up to $\\ell=3,000$. The lack of power on large angular scales is due to the limited size of our convergence maps, while the missing power on small scales is due to our particle resolution. On very small scales ($\\ell \\gtrsim 5 \\times 10^4$), excess power due to finite-pixelization shot noise arises, but this effect is negligible on the scales considered in our analysis.\n\nCMB lensing reconstruction {#sec:recon}\n--------------------------\n\n![image](plot/plot_maps.pdf){width=\"\\textwidth\"}\n\nIn order to obtain CMB lensing convergence maps with realistic noise properties, we generate lensed CMB temperature maps and reconstruct noisy estimates of the convergence field. First, we generate Gaussian random field CMB temperature maps based on a $\\Lambda$CDM concordance model temperature power spectrum computed with CAMB. We compute deflection field maps from the ray-traced convergence maps described in the previous sub-section, after applying a filter that removes power in the convergence maps above $\n\\ell \\approx 4,000$.[^6] These deflection maps are then used to lens the simulated primary CMB temperature maps. The lensing simulation procedure is described in detail in Ref.\u00a0[@Louis2013].\n\nAfter obtaining the lensed temperature maps, we apply instrumental effects consistent with specifications for the ongoing AdvACT survey\u00a0[@Henderson2016]. In particular, the maps are smoothed with a FWHM $=1.4$ arcmin beam, and Gaussian white noise of amplitude 6$\\mu$K-arcmin is then added.\n\nWe subsequently perform lensing reconstruction on these beam-convolved, noisy temperature maps using the quadratic estimator of Ref.\u00a0[@HuOkamoto2002], but with the replacement of unlensed with lensed CMB temperature power spectra in the filters, which gives an unbiased reconstruction to higher order [@Hanson2010]. The final result is a noisy estimate of the CMB lensing convergence field, with 1,000 realizations for each cosmological model (10,000 for the fiducial model).\n\nWe consider only temperature-based reconstruction in this work, leaving polarization estimators for future consideration. The temperature estimator is still expected to contribute more significantly than the polarization to the signal-to-noise for Stage-III CMB experiments like AdvACT, but polarization will dominate for Stage-IV (via $EB$ reconstruction). For the AdvACT-like experiment considered here, including polarization would increase the predicted signal-to-noise on the lensing power spectrum by $\\approx 35$%. More importantly, polarization reconstruction allows the lensing field to be mapped out to smaller scales than temperature reconstruction\u00a0[@HuOkamoto2002], and is more immune to foreground-related biases at high-$\\ell$\u00a0[@vanEngelen2014b]. Thus, it could prove extremely useful for higher-order CMB lensing statistics, which are sourced by non-Gaussian structure on small scales. Clearly these points are worthy of future analysis, but we restrict this work to temperature reconstruction for simplicity.\n\nIn addition to the fiducial model, we select the nearest eight points in the sampled parameter space (points circled in blue in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:design\\]) for the reconstruction analysis. We determine this selection by first reconstructing the nearest models in parameter space, and then broadening the sampled points until the interpolation is stable and the forecasted contours (see Sec.\u00a0\\[sec:constraints\\]) are converged for AdvACT-level noise. At this noise level, the other points in model space are sufficiently distant to contribute negligibly to the forecasted contours. In total, nine models are used to derive parameter constraints from the reconstructed, noisy maps. For completeness, we perform a similar convergence test using forecasted constraints from the noiseless maps, finding excellent agreement between contours derived using all 46 models and using only these nine models.\n\nIn Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:sample\\_maps\\], we show an example of a convergence map from the fiducial cosmology before (\u201cnoiseless\u201d) and after (\u201cnoisy\u201d) reconstruction. Prominent structures seen in the noiseless maps remain obvious in the reconstructed, noisy maps.\n\nGaussian random field\n---------------------\n\nWe also reconstruct a set of Gaussian random fields (GRF) in the fiducial model. We generate a set of GRFs using the average power spectrum of the noiseless $\\kappa$ maps. We then lens simulated CMB maps using these GRFs, following the same procedure as outlined above, and subsequently perform lensing reconstruction, just as for the reconstructed $N$-body $\\kappa$ maps. These noisy GRF-only reconstructions allow us to examine the effect of reconstruction (in particular the non-Gaussianity of the reconstruction noise itself), as well as to determine the level of non-Gaussianity in the noisy $\\kappa$ maps.\n\nInterpolation\n-------------\n\n![\\[fig:interp\\] Fractional differences between interpolated and \u201ctrue\u201d results for the fiducial power spectrum (top), PDF (middle), and peak counts (bottom). Here, we have built the interpolator using results for the other 45 cosmologies, and then compared the interpolated prediction at the fiducial parameter values to the actual simulated results for the fiducial cosmology. The error bars are scaled by $1/\\sqrt{N_{\\rm sims}}$, where the number of simulations $N_{\\rm sims}=1,000$. The agreement for all three statistics is excellent.](plot/plot_interp.pdf){width=\"48.00000%\"}\n\nTo build a model at points where we do not have simulations, we interpolate from the simulated points in parameter space using the Clough-Tocher interpolation scheme\u00a0[@alfeld1984; @farin1986], which triangulates the input points and then minimizes the curvature of the interpolating surface; the interpolated points are guaranteed to be continuously differentiable. In Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:interp\\], we show a test of the interpolation using the noiseless $\\kappa$ maps: we build the interpolator using all of the simulated cosmologies except for the fiducial model (i.e., 45 cosmologies), and then compare the interpolated results at the fiducial parameter values with the true, simulated results for that cosmology. The agreement for all three statistics is excellent, with deviations $\\lesssim$ few percent (and well within the statistical precision). Finally, to check the robustness of the interpolation scheme, we also run our analysis using linear interpolation, and obtain consistent results.[^7]\n\nAnalysis {#sec:analysis}\n========\n\nIn this section, we describe the analysis of the simulated CMB lensing maps, including the computation of the power spectrum, peak counts, and PDF, and the likelihood estimation for cosmological parameters. These procedures are applied in the same way to the noiseless and noisy (reconstructed) maps.\n\nPower spectrum, PDF, and peak counts\n------------------------------------\n\nTo compute the power spectrum, we first estimate the two-dimensional (2D) power spectrum of CMB lensing maps ($M_{\\kappa}$) using $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\label{eq: ps2d}\nC^{\\kappa \\kappa}(\\ellB) = \\hat M_{\\kappa}(\\ellB)^*\\hat M_{\\kappa}(\\ellB) \\,,\\end{aligned}$$ where $\\ellB$ is the 2D multipole with components $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$, $\\hat M_{\\kappa}$ is the Fourier transform of $M_{\\kappa}$, and the asterisk denotes complex conjugation. We then average over all the pixels within each $|\\ellB|\\in[\\ell-\\Delta\\ell, \\ell+\\Delta\\ell)$ bin, for 20 log-spaced bins in the range of $100<\\ell<2,000$, to obtain the one-dimensional power spectrum.\n\nThe one-point PDF is the number of pixels with values between \\[$\\kappa-\\Delta\\kappa$, $\\kappa+\\Delta\\kappa$) as a function of $\\kappa$. We use 50 linear bins with edges listed in Table\u00a0\\[tab: bins\\], and normalize the resulting PDF such that its integral is unity. The PDF is a simple observable (a histogram of the data), but captures the amplitude of all (zero-lag) higher-order moments in the map. Thus, it provides a potentially powerful characterization of the non-Gaussian information.\n\nPeaks are defined as local maxima in a $\\kappa$ map. In a pixelized map, they are pixels with values higher than the surrounding 8 (square) pixels. Similar to cluster counts, peak counts are sensitive to the most nonlinear structures in the Universe. For galaxy lensing, they have been found to associate with halos along the line of sight both with simulations\u00a0[@Yang2011] and observations\u00a0[@LiuHaiman2016]. We record peaks on smoothed $\\kappa$ maps, in 25 linearly spaced bins with edges listed in Table\u00a0\\[tab: bins\\].\n\n  ----------------------- ------------------ -----------------------\n      Smoothing scale       PDF bins edges    Peak counts bin edges\n         (arcmin)          (50 linear bins)     (25 linear bins)\n      0.5 (noiseless)      \\[-0.50, +0.50\\]     \\[-0.18, +0.36\\]\n      1.0 (noiseless)      \\[-0.22, +0.22\\]     \\[-0.15, +0.30\\]\n      2.0 (noiseless)      \\[-0.18, +0.18\\]     \\[-0.12, +0.24\\]\n      5.0 (noiseless)      \\[-0.10, +0.10\\]     \\[-0.09, +0.18\\]\n      8.0 (noiseless)      \\[-0.08, +0.08\\]     \\[-0.06, +0.12\\]\n   1.0, 5.0, 8.0 (noisy)   \\[-0.12, +0.12\\]     \\[-0.06, +0.14\\]\n  ----------------------- ------------------ -----------------------\n\n  : \\[tab: bins\\] PDF and peak counts bin edges for each smoothing scale (the full-width-half-maximum of the Gaussian smoothing kernel applied to the maps).\n\nCosmological constraints\n------------------------\n\nWe estimate cosmological parameter confidence level (C.L.) contours assuming a constant (cosmology-independent) covariance and Gaussian likelihood, $$\\begin{aligned}\nP (\\DB | \\pB) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi|\\CB|^{1/2}} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}(\\DB-\\muB)\\CB^{-1}(\\DB-\\muB)\\right],\\end{aligned}$$ where $\\DB$ is the data array, $\\pB$ is the input parameter array, $\\muB=\\muB(\\pB)$ is the interpolated model, and $\\CB$ is the covariance matrix estimated using the fiducial cosmology, with determinant $|\\CB|$. The correction factor for an unbiased inverse covariance estimator\u00a0[@dietrich2010] is negligible in our case, with $(N_{\\rm sims}-N_{\\rm bins}-2)/(N_{\\rm sims}-1) = 0.99$ for $N_{\\rm sims} =10,000$ and $N_{\\rm bins}=95$. We leave an investigation of the impact of cosmology-dependent covariance matrices and a non-Gaussian likelihood for future work.\n\nDue to the limited size of our simulated maps, we must rescale the final error contour by a ratio ($r_{\\rm sky}$) of simulated map size (12.25 deg$^2$) to the survey coverage (20,000 deg$^2$ for AdvACT). Two methods allow us to achieve this \u2014 rescaling the covariance matrix by $r_{\\rm sky}$ before computing the likelihood plane, or rescaling the final C.L. contour by $r_{\\rm sky}$. These two methods yield consistent results. In our final analysis, we choose the former method.\n\nResults {#sec:results}\n=======\n\nNon-Gaussianity in noiseless maps {#sec:non-gauss}\n---------------------------------\n\n![image](plot/plot_noiseless_PDF.pdf){width=\"48.00000%\"} ![image](plot/plot_noiseless_PDF_diff.pdf){width=\"48.00000%\"}\n\n![image](plot/plot_noiseless_peaks.pdf){width=\"48.00000%\"} ![image](plot/plot_noiseless_peaks_diff.pdf){width=\"48.00000%\"}\n\nWe show the PDF of noiseless $N$-body $\\kappa$ maps (PDF$^\\kappa$) for the fiducial cosmology in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:noiseless\\_PDF\\], as well as that of GRF $\\kappa$ maps (PDF$^{\\rm GRF}$) generated from a power spectrum matching that of the $N$-body-derived maps. To better demonstrate the level of non-Gaussianity, we also show the fractional difference of PDF$^\\kappa$ from PDF$^{\\rm GRF}$. The error bars are scaled to AdvACT sky coverage (20,000 deg$^2$), though note that no noise is present here.\n\nThe departure of PDF$^\\kappa$ from the Gaussian case is significant for all smoothing scales examined (FWHM = 0.5\u20138.0 arcmin), with increasing significance towards smaller smoothing scales, as expected. The excess in high $\\kappa$ bins is expected as the result of nonlinear gravitational evolution, echoed by the deficit in low $\\kappa$ bins.\n\nWe show the comparison of the peak counts of $N$-body $\\kappa$ maps (${\\rm N}^\\kappa_{\\rm peaks}$) versus that of GRFs (${\\rm N}^{\\rm GRF}_{\\rm peaks}$) in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:noiseless\\_pk\\]. The difference between ${\\rm N}^\\kappa_{\\rm peaks}$ and ${\\rm N}^{\\rm GRF}_{\\rm peaks}$ is less significant than the PDF, because the number of peaks is much smaller than the number of pixels \u2014 hence, the peak counts have larger Poisson noise. A similar trend of excess (deficit) of high (low) peaks is also seen in $\\kappa$ peaks, when compared to the GRF peaks.\n\nCovariance matrix {#sec:covariance}\n-----------------\n\n![\\[fig:corr\\_mat\\] Correlation coefficients determined from the full noiseless (top) and noisy (bottom) covariance matrices.

In contrast, the PDF and peak statistics show higher correlation in both self-covariance (i.e., the covariance within the sub-matrix for that statistic only) and cross-covariance, with strength almost comparable to the diagonal components. They both show strong correlation between nearby $\\kappa$ bins (especially in the moderate-$|\\kappa|$ regions), which arises from contributions due to common structures amongst the bins (e.g., galaxy clusters). Both statistics show anti-correlation between positive and negative $\\kappa$ bins. The anti-correlation may be due to mass conservation \u2014 e.g., large amounts of mass falling into halos would result in large voids in surrounding regions.\n\nIn the noisy case, the off-diagonal terms are generally smaller than in the noiseless case. Moreover, the anti-correlation seen previously between the far positive and negative $\\kappa$ tails in the PDF is now a weak positive correlation \u2014 we attribute this difference to the complex non-Gaussianity of the reconstruction noise. Interestingly, the self-covariance of the peak counts is significantly reduced compared to the noiseless case, while the self-covariance of the PDF persists to a reasonable degree.\n\nEffect of reconstruction noise {#sec:recon_noise}\n------------------------------\n\n![\\[fig:recon\\] We demonstrate the effect of reconstruction noise on the power spectrum (top), the PDF (middle), and peak counts (bottom) by using Gaussian random field $\\kappa$ maps (rather than $N$-body-derived maps) as input to the reconstruction pipeline. The noiseless (solid curves) and noisy/reconstructed (dashed curves) statistics are shown. All maps used here have been smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of FWHM $= 8$ arcmin.](plot/plot_reconstruction.pdf){width=\"48.00000%\"}\n\nTo disentangle the effect of reconstruction noise from that of nonlinear structure growth, we compare the three statistics before (noiseless) and after (noisy) reconstruction, using only the GRF $\\kappa$ fields. Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:recon\\] shows the power spectra, PDFs, and peak counts for both the noiseless (solid curves) and noisy (dashed curves) GRFs, all smoothed with a FWHM $= 8$ arcmin Gaussian window. The reconstructed power spectrum has significant noise on small scales, as expected (this is dominated by the usual \u201c$N^{(0)}$\u201d noise bias).\n\nThe post-reconstruction PDF shows skewness, defined as $$\\label{eq.skewdef}\nS=\\left\\langle \n\\left( \\frac {\\kappa-\\bar{\\kappa}}{\\sigma_\\kappa}\\right)^3 \\right\\rangle,$$ which is not present in the input GRFs. In other words, the reconstructed maps have a non-zero three-point function, even though the input GRF $\\kappa$ maps in this case do not. While this may seem surprising at first, we recall that the three-point function of the reconstructed map corresponds to a six-point function of the CMB temperature map (in the quadratic estimator formalism). Even for a Gaussian random field, the six-point function contains non-zero Wick contractions (those that reduce to products of two-point functions). Propagating such terms into the three-point function of the quadratic estimator for $\\kappa$, we find that they do not cancel to zero. This result is precisely analogous to the usual \u201c$N^{(0)}$ bias\u201d on the CMB lensing power spectrum, in which the two-point function of the (Gaussian) primary CMB temperature gives a non-zero contribution to the temperature four-point function. The result in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:recon\\] indicates that the similar PDF \u201c$N^{(0)}$ bias\u201d contains a negative skewness (in addition to non-zero kurtosis and higher moments). While it should be possible to derive this result analytically, we defer the full calculation to future work. If we filter the reconstructed $\\kappa$ maps with a large smoothing kernel, the skewness in the reconstructed PDF is significantly decreased (see Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:skew\\]). We briefly investigate the PDF of the Planck 2015 CMB lensing map\u00a0[@planck2015xv] and do not see clear evidence of such skewness \u2014 we attribute this to the low effective resolution of the Planck map (FWHM $\\sim$ few degrees). Finally, we note that a non-zero three-point function of the reconstruction noise could potentially alter the forecasted $\\kappa$ bispectrum results of Ref.\u00a0[@Namikawa2016] (where the reconstruction noise was taken to be Gaussian). The non-Gaussian properties of the small-scale reconstruction noise were noted in Ref.\u00a0[@HuOkamoto2002], who pointed out that the quadratic estimator at high-$\\ell$ is constructed from progressively fewer arcminute-scale CMB fluctuations.\n\nSimilarly, the $\\kappa$ peak count distribution also displays skewness after reconstruction, although it is less dramatic than that seen in the PDF. The peak of the distribution shifts to a higher $\\kappa$ value due to the additional noise in the reconstructed maps. We note that the shape of the peak count distribution becomes somewhat rough when large smoothing kernels are applied to the maps, due to the small number of peaks present in this situation (e.g., $\\approx 29$ peaks in a 12.25\u00a0deg$^2$ map with FWHM = 8 arcmin Gaussian window).\n\nNon-Gaussianity in reconstructed maps {#sec:non-gauss_recon}\n-------------------------------------\n\n![image](plot/plot_noisy_PDF_morebins.pdf){width=\"48.00000%\"} ![image](plot/plot_noisy_PDF_filtered_morebins.pdf){width=\"48.00000%\"}\n\n![image](plot/plot_noisy_peaks_morebins.pdf){width=\"48.00000%\"} ![image](plot/plot_noisy_peaks_filtered_morebins.pdf){width=\"48.00000%\"}\n\nWe show the PDF and peak counts of the reconstructed $\\kappa$ maps in Figs.\u00a0\\[fig:noisyPDF\\] and \\[fig:noisypk\\], respectively.

We further consider a Wiener filter, which is often used to filter out noise based on some known information in a signal (i.e., the noiseless power spectrum in our case). The right panels show the Wiener-filtered results, where we inverse-variance weight each pixel in Fourier space, i.e., each Fourier mode is weighted by the ratio of the noiseless power spectrum to the noisy power spectrum (c.f. Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:recon\\]), $$\\begin{aligned}\nf^{\\rm Wiener} (\\ell) = \\frac{C_\\ell^{\\rm noiseless}}{C_\\ell^{\\rm noisy}} \\,.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nCompared to the noiseless results shown in Figs.\u00a0\\[fig:noiseless\\_PDF\\] and\u00a0\\[fig:noiseless\\_pk\\], the differences between the PDF and peaks from the $N$-body-derived $\\kappa$ maps and those from the GRF-derived $\\kappa$ maps persist, but with less significance. For the Wiener-filtered maps, the deviations of the $N$-body-derived $\\kappa$ statistics from the GRF case are 9$\\sigma$ (PDF) and 6$\\sigma$ (peaks), where we derived the significances using the simulated covariance from the $N$-body maps [^8]. These deviations capture the influence of both nonlinear evolution and post-Born effects.\n\n![\\[fig:skew\\] Top panel: the skewness of the noiseless (triangles) and reconstructed, noisy (diamonds: $N$-body $\\kappa$ maps; circles: GRF) PDFs. Bottom panel: the fractional difference between the skewness of the reconstructed $N$-body $\\kappa$ and the reconstructed GRF. The error bars are for our map size (12.25 deg$^2$), and are only shown in the top panel for clarity.](plot/plot_skewness3.pdf){width=\"48.00000%\"}\n\nWhile the differences between the $N$-body and GRF cases in Figs.\u00a0\\[fig:noisyPDF\\] and \\[fig:noisypk\\] are clear, understanding their detailed structure is more complex. First, note that the GRF cases exhibit the skewness discussed in Sec.\u00a0\\[sec:recon\\_noise\\], which arises from the reconstruction noise itself. We show the skewness of the reconstructed PDF (for both the $N$-body and GRF cases) compared with that of the noiseless ($N$-body) PDF for various smoothing scales in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:skew\\]. The noiseless $N$-body maps are positively skewed, as physically expected. The reconstructed, noisy maps are negatively skewed, for both the $N$-body and GRF cases. However, the reconstructed $N$-body results are less negatively skewed than the reconstructed GRF results (bottom panel of Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:skew\\]), presumably because the $N$-body PDF (and peaks) contain contributions from the physical skewness, which is positive (see Figs.\u00a0\\[fig:noiseless\\_PDF\\] and\u00a0\\[fig:noiseless\\_pk\\]). However, the physical skewness is not large enough to overcome the negative \u201c$N^{(0)}$\u201d-type skewness coming from the reconstruction noise. We attribute the somewhat-outlying point at FWHM $=8$ arcmin in the bottom panel of Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:skew\\] to a noise fluctuation, as the number of pixels at this smoothing scale is quite low (the deviation is consistent with zero). The decrease in $|S|$ between the FWHM $=2$ arcmin and 1 arcmin cases in the top panel of Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:skew\\] for the noisy maps is due to the large increase in $\\sigma_{\\kappa}$ between these smoothing scales, as the noise is blowing up on small scales. The denominator of Eq.\u00a0(\\[eq.skewdef\\]) thus increases dramatically, compared to the numerator.\n\nComparisons between the reconstructed PDF in the $N$-body case and GRF case are further complicated by the fact that higher-order \u201cbiases\u201d arise due to the reconstruction. For example, the skewness of the reconstructed $N$-body $\\kappa$ receives contributions from many other terms besides the physical skewness and the \u201c$N^{(0)}$ bias\u201d described above \u2014 there will also be Wick contractions involving combinations of two- and four-point functions of the CMB temperature and $\\kappa$ (and perhaps an additional bias coming from a different contraction of the three-point function of $\\kappa$, analogous to the \u201c$N^{(1)}$\u201d bias for the power spectrum\u00a0[@Hanson2011]). So the overall \u201cbias\u201d on the reconstructed skewness will differ from that in the simple GRF case. This likely explains why we do not see an excess of positive $\\kappa$ values over the GRF case in the PDFs shown in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:noisyPDF\\]. While this excess is clearly present in the noiseless case (Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:noiseless\\_PDF\\]), and it matches physical intuition there, the picture in the reconstructed case is not simple, because there is no guarantee that the reconstruction biases in the $N$-body and GRF cases are exactly the same. Thus, a comparison of the reconstructed $N$-body and GRF PDFs contains a mixture of the difference in the biases and the physical difference that we expect to see. Similar statements hold for comparisons of the peak counts.\n\nClearly, a full accounting of all such individual biases would be quite involved, but the key point here is that all these effects are fully present in our end-to-end simulation pipeline. While an analytic understanding would be helpful, it is not necessary for the forecasts we present below.\n\nCosmological constraints {#sec:constraints}\n------------------------\n\nBefore we proceed to present the cosmological constraints from non-Gaussian statistics, it is necessary to do a sanity check by comparing the forecasted contour from our simulated power spectra to that from an analytic Fisher estimate, $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\FB_{\\alpha \\beta}=\\frac{1}{2} {\\rm Tr}\n\\left\\{\\CB^{-1}_{\\rm Gauss} \n\\left[\\left(\\frac {\\partial C_\\ell}{\\partial p_\\alpha} \\right)\n\\left(\\frac {\\partial C_\\ell}{\\partial p_\\beta}\\right)^T+ \n\\left(\\alpha\\leftrightarrow\\beta \\right)\n\\right]\\right\\},\\end{aligned}$$ where $\\left\\{ \\alpha,\\beta \\right\\} = \\left\\{ \\Omega_m,\\sigma_8 \\right\\}$ and the trace is over $\\ell$ bins. $\\CB_{\\rm Gauss}$ is the Gaussian covariance matrix, with off-diagonal terms set to zero, and diagonal terms equal to the Gaussian variance, $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\sigma^2_\\ell=\\frac{2(C_\\ell+N_\\ell)^2}{f_{\\rm sky}(2\\ell+1)\\Delta\\ell}\\end{aligned}$$\n\nWe compute the theoretical power spectrum $C_\\ell$ using the HaloFit model\u00a0[@Smith2003; @Takahashi2012], with fractional parameter variations of $+1$% to numerically obtain $\\partial C_\\ell / \\partial p$. $N_\\ell$ is the reconstruction noise power spectrum, originating from primordial CMB fluctuations and instrumental/atmospheric noise (note that we only consider white noise here). The sky fraction $f_{\\rm sky}=0.485$ corresponds to the 20,000 deg$^2$ coverage expected for AdvACT. $(F^{-1}_{\\alpha\\alpha})^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ is the marginalized error on parameter $\\alpha$. Both theoretical and simulated contours use the power spectrum within the $\\ell$ range of \\[100, 2,000\\]. The comparison is shown in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:contour\\_fisher\\]. The contour from full $N$-body simulations shows good agreement with the analytical Fisher contour. This result indicates that approximations made in current analytical CMB lensing power spectrum forecasts are accurate, in particular the neglect of non-Gaussian covariances from nonlinear growth. A comparison of the analytic and reconstructed power spectra will be presented in Ref.\u00a0[@Sherwin2016].\n\n![\\[fig:contour\\_fisher\\] 68% C.L. contours from an AdvACT-like CMB lensing power spectrum measurement. The excellent agreement between the simulated and analytic results confirms that non-Gaussian covariances arising from nonlinear growth and reconstruction noise do not strongly bias current analytic CMB lensing power spectrum forecasts (up to $\\ell = 2,000$).](plot/plot_contour_fisher.pdf){width=\"48.00000%\"}\n\nFig.\u00a0\\[fig:contour\\_noiseless\\] shows contours derived using noiseless maps for the PDF and peak count statistics, compared with that from the noiseless power spectrum. We compare three different smoothing scales (1.0, 5.0, 8.0 arcmin), and find that smaller smoothing scales have stronger constraining power. However, even with the smallest smoothing scale (1.0 arcmin), the PDF contour is still significantly larger than that of the power spectrum. Peak counts using 1.0 arcmin smoothing show almost equivalent constraining power as the power spectrum. However, we note that 1.0 arcmin smoothing is not a fair comparison to the power spectrum with cutoff at $\\ell<2,000$, because in reality, the beam size and instrument noise is likely to smear out signals smaller than a few arcmin scale (see below).\n\nAt first, it may seem surprising that the PDF is not at least as constraining as the power spectrum in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:contour\\_noiseless\\], since the PDF contains the information in the variance. However, this only captures an overall amplitude of the two-point function, whereas the power spectrum contains scale-dependent information.[^9] We illustrate this in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:cell\\_diff\\], where we compare the fiducial power spectrum to that with a 1% increase in $\\Omega_m$ or $\\sigma_8$ (while keeping other parameters fixed). While $\\sigma_8$ essentially re-scales the power spectrum by a factor $\\sigma_8^2$, apart from a steeper dependence at high-$\\ell$ due to nonlinear growth, $\\Omega_m$ has a strong shape dependence. This is related to the change in the scale of matter-radiation equality\u00a0[@planck2015xv]. Thus, for a noiseless measurement, the shape of the power spectrum contains significant additional information about these parameters, which is not captured by a simple change in the overall amplitude of the two-point function. This is the primary reason that the power spectrum is much more constraining than the PDF in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:contour\\_noiseless\\].\n\n![image](plot/plot_contour_noiseless_PDF_clough.pdf){width=\"48.00000%\"} ![image](plot/plot_contour_noiseless_Peaks_clough.pdf){width=\"48.00000%\"}\n\n![\\[fig:cell\\_diff\\] Fractional difference of the CMB lensing power spectrum after a 1% increase in $\\Omega_m$ (thick solid line) or $\\sigma_8$ (thin solid line), compared to the fiducial power spectrum.

We show results for three different filters \u2014 Gaussian windows of 1.0 and 5.0 arcmin and the Wiener filter. The 1.0 arcmin contour is the worst among all, as noise dominates at this scale. The 5.0 arcmin-smoothed and Wiener-filtered contours show similar constraining power. Using the PDF or peak counts alone, we do not achieve better constraints than using the power spectrum alone, but the parameter degeneracy directions for the statistics are slightly different. This is likely due to the fact that the PDF and peak counts probe non-linear structure, and thus they have a different dependence on the combination $\\sigma_8(\\Omega_m)^\\gamma$ than the power spectrum does, where $\\gamma$ specifies the degeneracy direction.\n\n  Combination         $\\Delta \\Omega_m$   $\\Delta \\sigma_8 $\n  ------------------ ------------------- --------------------\n  PS only                  0.0065               0.0044\n  PDF + Peaks              0.0076               0.0035\n  PS + PDF + Peaks         0.0045               0.0030\n\n  : \\[tab: constraints\\] Marginalized constraints on $\\Omega_m$ and $\\sigma_8$ for an AdvACT-like survey from combinations of the power spectrum (PS), PDF, and peak counts, as shown in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:contour\\_comb\\].\n\nThe error contour derived using all three statistics is shown in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:contour\\_comb\\], where we use the 5.0 arcmin Gaussian smoothed maps. The one-dimensional marginalized errors are listed in Table\u00a0\\[tab: constraints\\]. The combined contour shows moderate improvement ($\\approx 30\\%$ smaller error contour area) compared to the power spectrum alone. The improvement is due to the slightly different parameter degeneracy directions for the statistics, which break the $\\sigma_8$-$\\Omega_m$ degeneracy somewhat more effectively when combined. It is worth noting that we have not included information from external probes that constrain $\\Omega_m$ (e.g., baryon acoustic oscillations), which can further break the $\\Omega_m$-$\\sigma_8$ degeneracy.\n\nConclusion {#sec:conclude}\n==========\n\nIn this paper, we use $N$-body ray-tracing simulations to explore the additional information in CMB lensing maps beyond the traditional power spectrum. In particular, we investigate the one-point PDF and peak counts (local maxima in the convergence map). We also apply realistic reconstruction procedures that take into account primordial CMB fluctuations and instrumental noise for an AdvACT-like survey, with sky coverage of 20,000 deg$^2$, noise level 6 $\\mu$K-arcmin, and $1.4$ arcmin beam. Our main findings are:\n\n1.  We find significant deviations of the PDF and peak counts of $N$-body-derived $\\kappa$ maps from those of Gaussian random field $\\kappa$ maps, both in the noiseless and noisy reconstructed cases (see Figs.\u00a0\\[fig:noiseless\\_PDF\\],\u00a0\\[fig:noiseless\\_pk\\],\u00a0\\[fig:noisyPDF\\], and \\[fig:noisypk\\]). For AdvACT, we forecast the detection of non-Gaussianity to be $\\approx$ 9$\\sigma$ (PDF) and 6$\\sigma$ (peak counts), after accounting for the non-Gaussianity of the reconstruction noise itself. The non-Gaussianity of the noise has been neglected in previous estimates, but we show that it is non-negligible (Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:recon\\]).\n\n2.  We confirm that current analytic forecasts for CMB lensing power spectrum constraints are accurate when confronted with constraints derived from our $N$-body pipeline that include the full non-Gaussian covariance (Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:contour\\_fisher\\]).\n\n3.  An improvement of $\\approx 30\\%$ in the forecasted $\\Omega_m$-$\\sigma_8$ error contour is seen when the power spectrum is combined with PDF and peak counts (assuming AdvACT-level noise), compared to using the power spectrum alone. The covariance between the power spectrum and the other two non-Gaussian statistics is relatively small (with cross-covariance $< 20\\%$ of the diagonal components), meaning the latter is complementary to the power spectrum.\n\n4.  For noiseless $\\kappa$ maps (i.e., ignoring primordial CMB fluctuations and instrumental/atmospheric noise), a smaller smoothing kernel can help extract the most information from the PDF and peak counts (Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:contour\\_noiseless\\]). For example, peak counts of 1.0 arcmin Gaussian smoothed maps alone can provide equally tight constraints as from the power spectrum.\n\n5.  We find non-zero skewness in the PDF and peak counts of reconstructed GRFs, which is absent from the input noiseless GRFs by definition. This skewness is the result of the quadratic estimator used for CMB lensing reconstruction from the temperature or polarization maps. Future forecasts for non-Gaussian CMB lensing statistics should include these effects, as we have here, or else the expected signal-to-noise could be overestimated.\n\nIn this work, we have only considered temperature-based reconstruction estimators, but in the near future polarization-based estimators will have equally (and, eventually, higher) signal-to-noise. Moreover, the polarization estimators allow the lensing field to be mapped out to smaller scales, which suggests that they could be even more useful for non-Gaussian statistics.\n\nIn summary, there is rich information in CMB lensing maps that is not captured by two-point statistics, especially on small scales where nonlinear evolution is significant. In order to extract this information from future data from ongoing CMB Stage-III and near-future Stage-IV surveys, such as AdvACT, SPT-3G\u00a0[@Benson2014], Simons Observatory[^10], and CMB-S4\u00a0[@Abazajian2015], non-Gaussian statistics must be studied and modeled carefully. We have shown that non-Gaussian statistics will already contain useful information for Stage-III surveys, which suggests that their role in Stage-IV analyses will be even more important. The payoff of these efforts could be significant, such as a quicker route to a neutrino mass detection.\n\nWe thank Nick Battaglia, Francois Bouchet, Simone Ferraro, Antony Lewis, Mark Neyrinck, Emmanuel Schaan, and Marcel Schmittfull for useful discussions.

The higher significance for the PDF found here could be due to several reasons: (i) additional contributions to the signal-to-noise for the PDF from higher-order polyspectra beyond the bispectrum; (ii) inaccuracy of the nonlinear fitting formula used in Ref.\u00a0[@Pratten2016] on small scales, as compared to the N-body methods used here; (iii) reduced cancellation between the nonlinear growth and post-Born effects in higher-order polyspectra (for the bispectrum, these contributions cancel to a large extent, reducing the signal-to-noise\u00a0[@Pratten2016]).\n\n[^9]: Note that measuring the PDF or peak counts for different smoothing scales can recover additional scale-dependent information as well.\n\n[^10]: <http://www.simonsobservatory.org/>\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "ArXiv"}}, "DM

to tell us?\" \"If you're asking \"Am I infected?\", White, the answer is \"No\".\" \" I'm clean.\" \" But someone you know isn't.\" \"We all know someone with the virus, that's why they call it a pandemic.\" \"Nice evasive manoeuvre, but we're talking about the real reason you're here.\" \"Yeah...\" \"So, what relative is it?\" \"Is it your mum?\" \"Your dad?\" \"Little sister...\" \"It's my partner, OK?\" \"He can't afford suppressants, but they're discounted to employees - are you happy now?\" \"So who else is a charity case here?\" \"Yeah, you wouldn't speak up, if you were.\" \"Don't want to commit career suicide on camera like she just has.\" \"(BLACK) With a little help from you.\" \"I didn't create her situation, I just exposed it.\" \"(BLACK) Doesn't matter. lf she gets the answer right, she's still hired.\" \"Really?\" \"Says who?\" \"What...them?\" \" If memory serves me correct...\" \" The only rules in here are our rules.\" \"They can disqualify everyone!\" \"They can do whatever they like and we can't do a thing about it.\" \"So...congratulations!\" \"You've just disqualified yourself without breaking any rules.\" \"He won't kick you out, but you're dead in

\"I'm sure they're smart enough to realise that.\" \"And if I could talk to the CEO\" \"I'd assure him the treatment my partner needs will only deepen my commitment to his organisation for years to come.\" \"You really think he's behind there?\" \"He's lived behind walls for years.\" \"No one outside his inner circle has even seen him since the lPO.\" \"If he wanted to hire an assistant, this is the way he'd do it.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Proving my worth.\" \"You may have run out of ideas, but I haven't.\" \" Don't even try talking to him.\" \" I'm not gonna talk to him.\" \"Is there anything in there, or is he happy to see you?\" \"What have we here?\" \"Is that all?\" \"Heat may have an effect if the papers have been chemically treated.\" \" If we warmed them from beneath...\"

it, don't do it.\" \" Look on the bright side, brother (!\" \")\" \"If you start to convulse, we'll know you're telling the truth.\" \"Then we'll gladly help you.\" \"Looks like you've got your wish.\" \"For now.\" \"He had to be dealt with one way or another.\" \"I wouldn't be surprised if he was a plant all along.\" \"It's the kind of thing they'd do to stir up our internal dynamics.\" \"To set us against one another.\" \"If so, we've seized back the initiative.\" \"Or you have.\" \"He isn't smart enough to be a plant.\" \"But you on the other hand.\" \"You think she's one of them?\" \"Don't be absurd!\" \"I told you I'm a psychologist!\" \"You claimed to be a qualified student of psychology, not a practitioner.\" \"I've studied psychology too, and reverse psychology.\" \"What better way to hide your true role in this farce than to accuse another candidate of playing your part?\" \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" \"Amateur psychology is a useful tool for gamblers, but a degree in the subject sounds like the perfect foundation for a career in, say human resources.\" \"You're on the wrong side of the glass.\" \" He's the one who manipulated...\" \" Maybe you work as a team.\" \"He's got the mouth, but you... ..know an awful lot about Biorg Pharmaceuticals.\" \" I told you I applied!\" \" So did we.\" \" And I do my research!\" \" So did we!\" \"Any of us could be plants, but not all of us.\" \"At least one candidate has to be genuine for the test to be viable.\" \" That would be me.\" \" And me.\" \"My point is we can't prove anyone's guilt or innocence, so it's a waste of time to try.\" \"If we can't maintain trust and cooperation, we're through.\" \"Trust has to be earned, sister.\" \"We never had cause to trust each other in the first place.\" \"Trust is a choice.\" \"We can choose to keep cooperating, if necessary.\" \" I think it's necessary.\" \" We have no other option.\" \"Trust makes me nervous.\" \" I prefer proof.\" \" What are you doing?\" \" (SHOUTS) Get off me!\" \" Are you insane?\" \" Brown, why are you doing this?\" \" Because I like winning!\" \"Now tell us the truth, Dark.\" \"Please...\" \"You said we've to trust each other!\" \"Now you're gonna stand there while he interrogates me?\" \"Looks like it.\" \"They wanna know too.\" \"Further denials will only waste time.\" \"Confess and I'll release you.\" \"I promise.\" \"OK, I work for them, but they didn't put me in here!\" \"I heard about the job internally and applied like everyone else!\" \"Not everyone.\" \"Tell us what we want to know.\"

said, trust is a devalued currency in here.\" \"What proof can I possibly give you?\" \"You know, it's funny... how something so simple and inoffensive as a piece of paper, when placed in the wrong hands can become a deadly weapon.\" \"All from one slice of a tree.\" \" What are you doing?\" \" What has to be done.\" \"You're gonna torture me?\" \" Do something!\" \"Please!\" \" Brown, what are you doing?\" \" I know what I'm doing.\" \" You've done this before?\" \" In the services.\" \" I thought you were a gambler.\" \"All soldiers are gamblers.\" \"See, I find the flesh of the inner

right.\" \"We see what we want to see in here.\" \"You're a fighter so you all can think about is being the last man standing, but they never said there was only one position available.\" \"Yeah, I see what I want to see, Black.\" \"(GASPS)\" \"And you hear what you want to hear.\" \"But answer me this, brother (!\" \")\" \"What corporation doesn't know how many positions it's got available?\" \"What CEO can't decide whether he wants one assistant or eight?\" \"There's only one job going in his office, you know that?\" \"And the rest is fantasy.\" \"White, stay back!\" \"This ain't worth

All Rights Reserved. Smashwords Edition.\n\nISBN: 9781311309624\n\nDedicated to my Michael, who wonderfully supports me in all I do and makes my world a place of dreams.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nMany thanks to all of my friends who have read the various drafts of this book and have helped with the editing. Also, I want to express special appreciation to all the families I have met who have chosen adoption. Your stories and your families inspire me and give me hope for a better world.\nChapter 1\n\nMy name is Megan Johnson and I collect smiles, not the 'here's your change, have a nice day' kind of smiles, but real face brightening smiles. I'm not really sure when I started collecting. I can remember as a little girl telling my mom to smile when she was looking sad. I can remember trying to make my brothers laugh when they fell and scraped their knees. I can even remember practicing my smile in the bathroom mirror \u2013 both with and without my mom's lipstick.\n\nWhy smiles? Because they are happy things, and who doesn't love happy? My fellow collector, and all around best friend, Spencer and I started keeping a weekly tally about six years ago. It became a contest, really, with each of us trying to generate the most smiles for our collections. As a rule, we don't count our own smiles unless something really big happens.\n\nMy journal, which I'm not very good at writing in, contains each week's totals from both of us for at least the last four years. Sometimes I like to go back and look at it when I'm feeling down. I can't always remember the circumstances but there are a few weeks of really high or really low tallies that stand out.\n\nOne particular week I will never forget. It was the very first week I was in the hospital for my cancer treatments. I must have looked awful because no matter what I said or did, no one would give me a genuine smile. I remember how that discouraged me more than the pain or gloomy room. One night as I was finding it hard to sleep I flipped through the limited television channels looking for a distraction. I stopped at an old favorite from when I was little, Mr. Roger's Neighborhood. There was something comforting about its familiar music and his calm voice. I'd been surrounded by calm voices, lately everyone had taken to talking to me in hushed tones, but his was more than calm; it was happy. I watched for a few minutes and then as if it were just for me the camera zoomed in on his face and he smiled a real face lightening smile. It cheered me up so much. I recorded it as a half point in my journal because it seemed like cheating to give it full credit.\n\nThis week I'm not really sure I want to count all 136 smiles I've received, because again it seems like cheating. Everyone smiles at you the first couple of weeks of school. You know the smiles I mean, the 'oh, someone new, I should leave a good impression' kind. Jackie my roommate was a master at bringing these smiles out in people, so if I was with her it was all dimples and teeth and nice to meet you. She seemed to bounce her way through life and though she claimed to be shy, I hadn't seen it yet. The first weekend we'd baked bread to take to all of our neighbors. I counted those smiles because even though Jackie did all the baking, I washed the dishes afterwards.\n\nNow she was making enough spaghetti to feed an army and I wasn't even a troop. I watched her brush her hair out of her eyes with the back of her hand as she stirred her homemade sauce on the stove. She looked so domestic, kind of like a mom standing there in her pink apron. I took the hair scrunchie that I always wore on my wrist just in case and pulled her hair back for her.\n\n\"Oh! Thanks, Megan.\" This smile I could count.\n\n\"No problem, Jackie, but who's going to eat all of this?\"\n\n\"It's not that much. We'll just have leftovers.\"\n\n\"Yeah, leftovers for a week. When are Kristen and Melissa due back?\"\n\n\"I don't think until late tonight.\"\n\n\"Right, okay I'll be right back to set the table. You keep cooking.\"\n\nThe apartment complex we lived in had four buildings. Two of the buildings housed girls, and the other two were for the boys. I knew from experience that when it came to large quantities of food, nothing beat boys. With purpose, I set off across the parking lot to the first stairwell of building D. I loved Jackie's cooking but I was not going to eat leftover spaghetti for a week.\n\nThere was no answer at the first door I knocked on so I climbed the stairs and tried again. This time before the door even opened, I knew someone was home because I could hear the television. The door edged open a little and a tanned, freckled face peeped out.\n\n\"Can I help you?\"\n\n\"Yes, my name is Megan and I live across the way in building A. I was wondering if you and your roommates would like to come over for dinner.\"\n\n\"Umm... come in.\" He opened the door wide enough for me to pass inside. The apartment was a mirror image of ours even down to the furniture, which the complex must have ordered in bulk. The one big difference was the TV in the corner. It was blaring ESPN and the guy seated on the edge of the couch was glued. \"Nathan, this is Megan.\" Nathan glanced up and gave a halfhearted wave before redirecting his eyes to the game.\n\n\"Hi, Nathan.\"\n\n\"Wait here. I'll go get the others.\"\n\nI wondered over to the sofa and sat down without an invitation. I doubted Nathan was much for manners. I studied the side of his face looking for any clue as to how I might win a smile from him. I suspected he was a hard nut to crack, but with time, I felt up to the challenge. With his close cropped hair and his soccer obsession, he reminded me a lot of my brother, Matt.\n\n\"Megan, is it?\" I stood looking at the two guys that were standing near the hall. A familiar face with sandy blond hair greeted me. I was not sure how to count the smile, I suspected it was one of those first meeting kind. \"I understand you bring an invitation.\"\n\n\"My roommate Jackie and I are in need of some assistance. You would really be helping us out if you guys came to dinner. We have an issue with portion control at our place, and I'm not overly fond of leftovers.\"\n\nSmirks are good, but they don't count. \"Sounds great. What do you say, Mark?\" The tall, floppy haired guy next to Andy smiled politely, but seemed distracted.\n\n\"I guess so. Thanks, Megan. I just need to send a text first.\" He pulled his phone out of his pocket and headed back down the hall to his room. Andy smirked again and shook his head affectionately at his roommate.\n\n\"Well, that's two so far. How about you, John, shall we dine with the ladies?\"\n\nJohn shrugged an approval then looked down at the floor. A smile from this one may be completely out of my depth. He was obviously very shy, the way Jackie insisted she was but only real.\n\nI looked over at Nathan who seemed oblivious to what was happening around him. \"What about you?\" I tried to call out during a lull in the game.\n\n\"Don't worry about Nathan. He'll be there. I guess that makes all of us. You may count on four for dinner.\"\n\n\"Great, give us about 20 minutes. We are in apartment 7A. See you soon.\"\n\nI was feeling pretty proud of myself as I walked into my apartment. Ours smelled so homey and was brighter than D41 had been. Jackie would be so happy that we were having guests. I snuck up behind her as she was draining the pasta. She only jumped a little when I clamped my hand down on her shoulder, but the pan clanged into the sink.\n\n\"Oh! You scared me!\"\n\n\"Sorry, but I have good news. We are having guests for dinner.\"\n\n\"Well it's kind of short notice, but there's plenty. Who is it, A11, or B24? Did you invite Rachel?\"\n\n\"Nope, it's D41.\"\n\n\"D41? But that's the boys' dorms.\" I watched as terror slowly spread across her face. It was kind of amazing to see the expression creep into place and then freeze.\n\n\"Jackie, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"You invited boys?\"\n\n\"Is that a problem? I just figured they were the best choice given the amount of spaghetti you made.\"\n\n\"But I can't talk to boys.\" She bit at her lip while she yanked at the ties of her apron. \"I've got to change, do my makeup and my hair. When are they coming?\"\n\n\"In about 15 minutes.\"\n\n\"Fifteen minutes?\" She dashed down the hall and called over her shoulder. \"You can finish the salad and set the table. Don't forget the placemats.\"\n\nI was used to Jackie overreacting but this was a bit much, even for her. I got out the treasured powder blue placemats she'd made for a young women's project and paid strict attention to my place settings. I was more of a paper plate kind of girl but it was important to Jackie, and I had apparently caused her some distress. I thought back over the last couple of weeks with her and all of our trips around to meet people. She was usually so outgoing and then it hit me, all those visits had been to girls. Was she really not able to talk to boys? Between her, Nathan, and John, dinner should be interesting. Maybe I would have to pull out my silly jokes to keep things going.\n\nThe doorbell rang as I was putting the salad on the table. Jackie hurried down the hall and paused casually near the kitchen counter. Well, she tried for casual but her fidgeting hands gave her away. I gave her an encouraging smile and opened the door. They all filed in and I turned to introduce them to Jackie but she was no longer there. I found her by the sink filling up glasses with water.\n\n\"Jackie, this is Andy, John, Nathan, and Mark. Guys, this is Jackie, my roommate and the cook.\"\n\nAndy stepped forward and offered his hand to shake but Jackie panicked and handed him the glass of water in her hand instead. \"Thank you. Do you need help with anything else?\" I had to give him full marks for effort. He was a bit formal, but definitely nice.\n\n\"Um... no. I've got it.\" Jackie gave him a small smile that showed just the start of one dimple on her right cheek and turned for more glasses.\n\n\"Have a seat. We should have everything on the table soon.\" I said, then followed Jackie into the kitchen. \"You're doing fine, just take a deep breath and let's go.\"\n\nJackie nodded and fixed a smile on her face that couldn't have looked more fake if she was a mannequin.\n\nAfter the prayer, we were off to a rocky start. Nathan began to shovel spaghetti in his mouth in a spot-on impersonation of my brother, Drew. Jackie stared at her plate and kept adjusting the napkin in her lap.\n\n\"Does anyone know why when birds fly south one of the legs of the V is longer than the other?\"\n\nEveryone turned their eyes to me and I smiled wickedly. Someone had given me a book of nonsense jokes while I was in the hospital. In my boredom, I'd memorized them all in just a couple of days. One of my favorite things about these kinds of jokes were the groans they induced. I should probably start collecting those too, they can be just as fun as smiles. Nathan seemed to be pondering a solution and the look of frustration on his face made me laugh. Mark beamed at me through his dark lashes, amusement apparent on his face. I counted it.\n\n\"So what's the answer?\" Jackie asked.\n\n\"Do you give up?\"\n\n\"No!\" Nathan blurted out. He tapped his fingers on the table in a rapid rhythm.\n\n\"Come on, Nathan. You'll never get it, just let her tell us.\" Andy was watching me as if I might steal second base.\n\n\"Fine. What's the answer?\"\n\nI paused a moment waiting to savor the groans. \"Because there are more birds on that side.\"\n\nI was not disappointed.\n\nBy the end of dinner, Jackie seemed to be feeling better. Andy and Mark were both really good at making conversation. Originally, we'd fallen back on the basics like where we were from and what our majors were, but eventually we got some more interesting facts.\n\nI felt a little forgetful when it came out that Andy was the new Elder's Quorum President for our ward. No wonder he'd looked familiar. Mark and Andy had also been mission companions in Atlanta. You could tell they were close. John was a man of few words and most of them were monosyllable but I suspect that was mostly to hide his Texas accent.\n\nWhen phone numbers were exchanged, plans made for the next day, and the dishes done, Jackie went screaming through the house. \"I can't believe you did that.\" She paused long enough to put her hands on my shoulders and look me in the eyes. \"I thought I was going to die. But they are so sweet and cute.\" She jumped up and down still holding my shoulders. \"Thank you, thank you, thank you!\" Then she smiled and I counted it.\n\nI called Mom the next morning just to hear her voice. I'd missed her this week. \"Megan, your timing is perfect. I'm just sitting here at Kelly's dance practice.\"\n\nMy little sister was very graceful and had quite the talent for ballet. Mom was amused that they had tried a modern dance piece this time and Kelly wasn't sure she wanted to wiggle her hips the way the other girls did. \"I'm proud of her modesty,\" Mom said before she switched subjects. \"Megan, I've been wondering when your test results are coming back. Did Dr. Swenson tell you when to expect them? They usually don't take this long.\"\n\nOh, no. I was hoping she had forgotten about that. \"No, I didn't actually go to the appointment,\" I said weakly.\n\n\"What!\" Mom was not happy. I jumped in to defend myself before she got too angry.\n\n\"Mom, I wasn't able to get off work that day. They really needed me. It's no big deal. I feel fine.\"\n\nMom was taking deep breaths, deep cleansing breaths like the ones you take to avoid yelling at someone and then you do it anyway. It was the same breathing exercise I had seen her do many times when dealing with my twin brothers, Matt and Drew.\n\n\"Megan, I understand that you hate these appointments, but you know that they are important.\" She sighed, \"It would have been better if you had seen Dr. Swenson, but I guess it is time you established yourself with a doctor there. Normally, I would trust you to make these kinds of arrangements, but since it is clear that you do not want to do this ... I will take care of it.\"\n\n\"Okay, Mom. I need to go now. I have homework. Bye.\" I hung up the phone, feeling guilty for missing the appointment and also for lying about the homework. I just didn't want to talk to her anymore. I didn't want to talk about that. Why did this have to be such a big deal?\n\nI spent the better part of the next afternoon helping my roommates pick out their clothes. Jackie was kind of a lost cause with all the pink in her closet so we gathered all the dark shirts and pants we could find and threw them on my bed. Melissa was excited to meet the guys that Jackie had been gushing about all day. Kristen thought it might be fun, but since she had a steady boyfriend, she wasn't all that interested in the prospects in D41.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen the boys showed up at 8:35, they were decked out for the occasion. Nathan was especially prepared, dressed in black from head to toe. I thought the knit cap was a nice touch but he did look like a bank robber. Andy stood out because of his conspicuous use of cologne. He must have had the same dilemma Jackie and Melissa did. He smelled nice but it was a bit strong; he would be easy to track in the dark.\n\nMark apologized for making everyone late and explained that his phone call home had run a little long. None of the other girls seemed inclined to chastise him for it and I couldn't fault them - with his curly dark hair and endearing smile there was little to dislike.\n\n\"Is something up?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not really. My brother, Christian, just needed some help with his homework.\" That was nice. I wondered if my brothers would be that nice if I called them for things like that.\n\nKristen took charge and introduced herself and Melissa. This started a round of introductions that included much of the information from last night. The girls of course already knew all these details from Jackie's briefing earlier, but the guys didn't need to know that.\n\n\"We should go before it gets too late,\" Nathan said. We were led out to Nathan's and Andy's little cars. Andy gestured for me to get into his car and I climbed into the front passenger seat. I looked in the backseat and immediately felt guilty because Mark was sitting with his knees almost to his chest.\n\n\"Do you want the front seat? You look uncomfortable.\"\n\n\"No, I'm fine. It's a short ride.\" He smiled at me, it was a nice smile, but I didn't count it because he still looked so awkward and uncomfortable.\n\nThere were lots of big bushes and trees at the park. We huddled together to quickly review the rules for sardine hide and seek. Once everyone knew what they were doing, we all closed our eyes and John sneaked off quietly to hide.\n\nOne hundred counts later, we split up to look for him. I went to the right towards a pair of large bushes that were barely visible in the dark. Just before I reached the first bush, I looked back toward the others. Jackie was coming in my direction too, only she was aiming toward the farther bush. I could see three other outlines in the distance spread out over the field. Two were missing? Had they found John already? I decided to go with my original plan anyway.\n\nI circled the bush, which was actually a pine tree whose branches sagged to the ground. Slowly I went looking for any signs; still, I nearly missed it. Just before I gave up and headed to the other bush, I caught sight of a white piece of shoe sticking out from under the bush. I dropped to my knees immediately, hoping that I could get hidden before Jackie saw me. I scrambled under the bush next to John. In the darkness, it was hard to be sure, but I thought I saw him bury his face in his arms. Luckily, the tree was big enough to conceal me. My legs were much shorter that his.\n\nJackie was approaching us now. I tried to hold my breath but it was difficult. My heart beating fast, from my mad rush to shimmy under the low branches of the pine on my stomach. She circled once and didn't see us. After taking a few steps away, something made her turn and come back. This time she crawled around looking for us. One pair of white shoes later she was scrunching in under the branches on the other side of John.\n\n\"Hi guys.\" she whispered. \"It sure is tight under here.\"\n\n\"Just wait.\" I whispered back.\n\nJohn shushed us and Jackie giggled. \"It's okay everyone else is still clear across the field. That's how I knew you must be here, 'cause Megan wasn't out there and because your shoes stick out, John.\" He began to wiggle further towards the large trunk to hide his feet better, but there was only so far he could go. The movement stirred up the dirt in the lower branches of the pine. I tried to stifle a sneeze, but it was too late. I buried my face in my arms and tried to sneeze as quietly as I could.\n\nWe laid there in the stillness waiting to be discovered. Jackie was still giggling softly, now and then, as the pressure got to her. John's head hadn't come up from his arms in a while. This closeness must be really difficult for someone as shy as he was.\n\nBeing short has its disadvantages. The next person to join us saw John's feet again and tried to climb in next to him right on top of me. I groaned then tried to move out of the person's way. \"Sorry,\" a soft voice said from my right.\n\n\"It's okay.\" I whispered. Soft curls brushed my face as he scooted into place so it must be Mark. I moved a little farther away to give him more room. A moment later, there was rustling sound of someone climbing in on the other side of Jackie. I counted in my head. There were still three searchers. How could we fit two more people under here? We went at least half way around the bush now and surely, Mark's feet were sticking out too. It wouldn't be long before we were all caught.\n\nThe next one to slide in on my left was Andy; the musky/floral smell gave him away instantly. It blended nicely with the pine scent. He had just gotten settled when we heard. \"Okay, we know you guys are in there. You can come out now.\" There was a collective sigh of relief as people started to back up, scooting along on their bellies. Standing near the bush were Nathan, who was nearly invisible in his black and Melissa who was laughing at us as we dusted off.\n\n\"Great hiding place, John.\" Nathan said appreciatively. \"I think I can top it.\"\n\nWe stretched and Nathan, excited for his turn, ran off into the dark. \"Start counting,\" he called over his shoulder. I picked sticks and pine needles out of my hair as I counted along with the group.\n\nThe counting done, I headed out across the field towards the distant tree line. Only the light from the occasional street lamp lit the park enough for me to make out shapes; it was truly dark now. I was aware that someone was following close behind me, probably Jackie. I changed my course so that I could shake her pursuit. \"Megan, wait up.\" an unexpected voice called from the darkness.\n\n\"Andy?\"\n\n\"John said you were the first to find him. I thought I would tag along with you.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said feeling a little weird. I slowed my pace and he was soon beside me. We made our way towards the line of trees again. Looking for Nathan proved to be very difficult. I was sure that he was the best hide and seeker I had ever come across. We walked from tree to tree looking up into them. From the figures moving around in the darkness, I didn't think anyone else had found him either. Twenty minutes later, there were just as many seekers as there had been at the beginning of the game. We gathered in the middle of the field. My eyes scanned the park looking for anyplace we hadn't searched.\n\n\"Nathan!\" Mark and Andy called.\n\n\"Nathan!\" we all joined in. \"We give up.\"\n\nAfter a moment, Nathan appeared behind us. \"Told you I could do better,\" he said smugly. I counted his smile because it was so impish and full of fun. It hadn't taken me as long to get a smile out of him as I'd expected.\n\n\"That was definitely a good hiding place. Where were you?\"\n\n\"I'll never tell. Maybe I can use it next time.\"\n\n\"It's getting pretty late.\" Kristen said with a yawn. She was taking 18 credits this semester and she'd had a long week.\n\n\"This was really fun! We should do it again,\" Jackie added. Then she smiled. I was getting a lot of smiles from her this week. There were several head nods around the group and I was glad that everyone was happy.\n\nWe climbed back into the cars and this time I offered Mark the front seat. He shook his head and climbed in the back, knees to his chest. I started to feel guilty, but then I saw that he was sitting next to Jackie again, and I thought that maybe he had chosen that seat on purpose. She certainly looked comfortable.\nChapter 2\n\nThe guys gave us a ride to church the next day. Already we were starting to act like a group. As the week went by, it seemed much of my free time was spent at apartment D41, or at least out on the basketball courts with its occupants.\n\nNathan was the fiercest competitor; he hated to lose to a girl but I wasn't really very good at basketball so he didn't have to worry much. Playing against John and Mark was kind of pointless; they only had to hold the ball over their head and I couldn't reach. Andy wasn't that bad of an opponent: like me, he wasn't very good, but he had fun playing. He and I lost miserably in a game of two on two with Nathan and John.\n\nFriday, I made several batches of double chocolate chip cookies. They were my brother George's favorite. He'd just gotten off his mission last February and was attending ASU this year because it was close to home and to Lindsey.\n\nI'd been hoping that he would be attending BYU with me this year, but Lindsey had swept him off his feet as soon as he'd gotten home. I was lucky to spend any time with him this last summer. It just worked out that Lindsey was gone for a family trip at the end of July so George and I had gone camping. That's when he told me he was going to be asking Lindsey to marry him. I was still waiting to hear back how it went.\n\nI planned to share the cookies with my new friends. My cooking skills were nearly nonexistent but I knew guys enough to know that food was always a good idea and this was something I could make. It was kind of a way to say thank you for making me feel like I had my brothers around me again. I preferred my life crowded with people and smiles.\n\nJohn answered the door again and greeted me with an awkward gulp, despite the fact that he knew me well now.\n\n\"I brought cookies,\" I said, holding the plate up.\n\nThis brought Nathan to life on the sofa. His head popped up at the invitation but he quickly turned back to the game. In a perfect impression of my younger brother, Matt, he got up, backed toward the plate, and snagged a few cookies all while keeping his eyes on the television screen. Ah, just like home, I sighed contentedly.\n\nThe first door in the hallway opened and Andy came through it talking over his shoulder as he went. When he saw me, he smiled a bright, happy to see you, kind of smile. I counted it. These guys were always smiling. It was wonderful to have such happy friends.\n\n\"Megan, I didn't know you were here. What grand adventure do you have planned tonight?\"\n\n\"No adventure, just cookies,\" I said waving a hand at the half empty plate. Next time, I would have to bring more or limit Nathan to two.\n\nHe reached for one eagerly and took a big bite. \"These are awesome! Shame about the adventure, though. Mark and I were just trying to decide what to do tonight.\"\n\nI thought about that for a moment. \"What, no dates? You two really have to stop waiting for the girls to come to you.\"\n\nAndy blushed slightly at that, then said impishly, \"But it works, look here you are, with food again.\"\n\nTrying to ignore how true that was, I suggested, \"The courts were full when I came over but maybe we could play some board games?\"\n\n\"Yeah, that sounds good. I have Sorry?\"\n\n\"Excellent. We should make some popcorn or something. Do you have any?\"\n\n\"That would be a good thing to have, but no. Sorry.\"\n\n\"No problem. I will go and make some and see if anyone else wants to join us, okay?\"\n\n\"We may need more than one game if we get too many people. Got any?\"\n\n\"I have a couple: Pictionary, Skip Bo, and Trivial Pursuit.\"\n\n\"Wow. You came to school prepared.\"\n\n\"Recreation major, remember. Besides, I like games. I'll be back soon.\" Then I left to get the girls and more snacks because the cookies were all gone.\n\n* * *\n\nThe next morning I lay in bed for a long time trying to get up and moving. After games, we'd decided to attend a late night movie and I was feeling it. My phone rang and Jackie groaned. \"Sorry,\" I whispered, getting out of bed. I grabbed my phone and answered it so the ring tone would stop. \"Just a minute,\" I whispered. When I was out in the hall, with the door closed behind me, I said, \"Hi, Mom. What's up?\"\n\n\"Did you just wake up, Megan? It's ten in the morning.\" It was amazing how she could scold just as good over the phone as she could in person.\n\n\"Yeah, I had a late night,\" I yawned.\n\n\"Well, wake up and get a calendar.\" Startled by the request, I reached for my backpack sitting in the corner of the dining room and found my ratty old planner in the front pocket.\n\n\"Okay Mom, I'm ready.\"\n\n\"Good, how does next Tuesday look in the afternoon, say around three?\"\n\n\"Fine.\" I said puzzled. Then I remembered my last conversation with my mom. I thought quickly, \"Hey Mom, I was thinking I should probably just stay with Dr. Swenson. He knows my case and everything so could you make me an appointment for Thanksgiving time?\"\n\n\"That would work except for the fact that your brother is getting married that weekend. Besides, I already have an appointment for you with a doctor there.\"\n\n\"George is getting married. He didn't tell me that he had proposed already. When? Thanksgiving? Wow, that is fast.\" I was so excited I didn't even care about the appointment.\n\n\"Yes, they haven't left me much time to plan things. At least her family is doing most of the reception. We will need to fly you home so that you will be here for the whole thing. Lindsey wants you to be a bridesmaid.\"\n\n\"Okay, just tell me what you need me to do and I will be there. And could you hit George for me for not giving me the details like he promised.\"\n\n\"He probably wouldn't even notice. He is on his own planet at the moment. Now, Megan, I am serious about this appointment. You told me you are free so I expect you to go. Dr. Swenson is sending copies of all your records, so you have no excuse. I have emailed you all the information. I expect to hear from you Tuesday night to tell me how it went.\"\n\nShe was going to be difficult about this, apparently. \"Okay, Mom. Tell George and Lindsey congrats for me.\"\n\n\"Love you, Megan.\"\n\n\"I love you too, Mom.\"\n\nI hung up the phone worrying now about the appointment. I hated feeling burdened by this. How frustrating that my plan for skipping it this year didn't work. I grabbed some cereal and tried to focus on my day. There just wasn't enough homework to keep me busy. Besides, I needed something to lighten my mood. Today would be a good day for a bike ride.\n\nI stopped by D41 on my way out just to remind them about the concert. This time when I entered, I met Nathan's twin sister.\n\n\"Hi, I'm Emily,\" she said as she practically bounced across the room to me. Emily was a couple of inches taller than Nathan, but had similar features making their relationship obvious. She was spunky and sweet with beautiful dark eyes that almost twinkled.\n\n\"I'm Megan; it's really nice to meet you Emily.\" She dragged me to the sofa and plopped me down to join the group watching some rerun of a game. She treated me like an old friend.\n\n\"I just came to remind you guys about Melissa's concert tonight, if you can make it.\"\n\n\"You should stay here with us, Megan. After the game, we are all heading out for some ice cream. Come with us.\" She glanced between John and me as if sizing up the competition. Then she smiled at me but it was too territorial for me to count.\n\n\"Thanks but I really had my heart set on a ride. It sounds like you guys have plans though, so I will go.\" I jumped up before she could object, it wasn't really necessary; she wasn't going to be sad about my leaving her alone with John. I couldn't help finding the whole thing funny as I got on my bike. Emily was definitely in flirt mode and I couldn't help thinking about the discomfort that was going to cause John and Nathan.\n\nI rode along through town staying focused and aware of the Saturday traffic. Once I passed the freeway, things were less crowded. It felt good to get out and bike somewhere flat. I pedaled as fast as I could, enjoying the breeze it created. I really didn't want to think about my upcoming appointment so I focused on the movie we'd seen last night. It was nice that I had made some good friends but I still missed Spencer. He and I had done everything together since we met in eighth grade. Playing ball and games with the guys was fine, but Spencer was who I really needed right now. Knowing how hard these yearly appointments were for me, he always planned something fun to do afterwards. I didn't have anyone here to talk to and I could feel some panic rising.\n\nI arrived at the park that sat beside Utah Lake. It was very quiet today; I was surprised because it was beautiful. I laid down on my stomach, giving my backside a rest. I could feel the warm sun on the back of my neck, thanks to the braid I'd hastily done this morning. It was an unusual sensation for me; my thick, curly hair was always in the way. I tried not to be too frustrated that I didn't have the soft manageable hair like my sister's. It could be a lot worse, as I knew first hand. There had been a time when any hair would have been nice, though I had a cool collection of hats.\n\nLaying there, I listened to the ducks splashing at the edge of the lake. When I woke up the sun was no longer overhead but setting. I drowsily looked at my watch. Great, there was only a half an hour until the concert; why did I fall asleep? If I was going to get there on time, I was going to need a ride. I picked up my phone and called Mark because he was the only one with a truck for my bike.\n\n\"Hey Megan?\" said a soft tenor voice.\n\n\"Hi Mark. I hate to ask, but I need a ride.\"\n\n\"Sure, when and where?\"\n\n\"Well actually... I'm at Utah Lake. I fell asleep and Melissa's concert starts in about 30 minutes.\"\n\n\"Are you there at the park?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I'm on my way,\" he hung up.\n\nI stretched then groaned, I had been sleeping for about three hours and that pleasant sun had burned my neck and the back of my legs. Well, I'd had worse. I stood and dusted off the grass that was stuck to my shirt and shorts. Unfortunately, dusting off didn't take care of the wrinkles. At least, I was wearing something without stains; still, it was a little casual for the concert. I checked my watch again; changing wasn't going to happen.\n\nMy phone rang and I checked to make sure it wasn't my mom. I didn't really want to talk to her now. \"Hello?\"\n\n\"Hey, it's just me. I'm almost there.\"\n\n\"Oh, Hi Mark. Thank you so much for doing this. I hope I'm not interrupting any plans?\"\n\n\"No, I was just waiting at home for a call from my sister but I can wait for that anywhere.\"\n\n\"Good, then do you want to go to Melissa's concert with me? It's her first and she's a little nervous.\"\n\n\"I'm not really dressed for it.\"\n\n\"If you are wearing something other than a t-shirt and shorts you will be better dressed than me.\" I was glad that the concert wasn't being held in one of the big auditoriums because they probably wouldn't even let me in. \"We can just sneak in back and slip out before anyone notices us.\"\n\n\"You're on,\" he said with enthusiasm.\n\n\"I'm going to hang up now I have something to take care of.\"\n\n\"Okay, see you soon. Be watching for me.\"\n\nI was relieved to find the bathrooms open. I splashed some cool water from the sink on my neck hoping to calm the sting. My legs didn't hurt unless I bent my knee too far. They would probably ache all through the concert but that's what I get for falling asleep in the sun, even on a pleasant day. I heard a horn honk, he was closer than I'd thought. I slowly walked out of the restroom trying not to feel my legs.\n\nWaving so that Mark could see me, I walked over to where my bike was laying on the grass. When Mark saw where I was headed he hopped out of the truck and jogged over to it. We got there about the same time. \"I've got it,\" he said, picking up my bike.\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said smiling back at him, secretly glad that I wouldn't have to bend down to get it.\n\nHe carefully lifted it into the back of his truck and opened the passenger door for me. I gingerly climbed in extending my legs out again as soon as I could. He laughed and gave me an odd look, \"My truck doesn't bite.\" He closed my door and walked around to his door.\n\n\"I just have a little sunburn.\" I explained as he backed up.\n\n\"How bad?\"\n\n\"It's nothing, I've had worse. The concert is in the HFAC.\" I looked at my watch. \"It starts in 15 minutes.\"\n\n\"We'll make it even with a stop.\"\n\n\"A stop?\" but I didn't get an answer to my question right then, because Mark's phone rang.\n\n\"Hi, Rebecca.\" There was a pause. \"Hey, sorry but I can't talk now. I will call you tomorrow after church, okay? Love you too. Bye.\"\n\n\"That's nice.\" I said reflexively. \"My brothers never call and they never say I love you.\"\n\nHe smirked, \"I guess I'm just an awesome brother then.\" I collected another smile.\n\n\"I guess so!\"\n\nHe laughed but I was serious. In the time that I had known him, Mark was forever on the phone with his brothers or sisters; helping them with homework or just catching up.\n\nWe pulled into a pharmacy parking lot. \"Wait here, I will be really fast.\" Three minutes later, he was back with a small bag in his hand. \"Put this on it will help.\"\n\nI looked into the bag he handed me. \"Aloe Vera Gel?\"\n\n\"It's really good for sunburns.\"\n\n\"I know. I've just never seen it in a bottle before. We have a big plant of it growing in the backyard.\"\n\n\"Good, then you know it is a bit sticky at first. Still, it beats the pain.\"\n\nI opened the bottle and sniffed the very faint odor. It was the same stuff. Mark took the bottle from my hand and squeezed a small amount into his palm. \"Hold your hair out of the way,\" he ordered. I leaned closer holding my braid up. The cool gel on my neck was heavenly, I sighed. \"This is pretty red, I hope you don't blister.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" I continued to hold my braid up waiting for the gel to dry. Mark rubbed his hands together as if he was washing them.\n\n\"No problem. It's good for dry skin too.\" he held his hands up as if to prove it. \"You can get your legs while we drive. We should get going.\"\n\n\"What do you do that makes your hands so dry?\" I hadn't seen rough dry skin like that since my hands last winter when I had tried skiing without the proper gear.\n\n\"I wash them a lot.\" He looked at me a moment then went on, \"I'm a nurse's assistant at a nursing home here in town.\" He looked at me again expecting some kind of reaction.\n\n\"Wow, do you like it?\"\n\nHe smiled, \"Yes I do. And it's good training. I'm going to be a nurse.\"\n\n\"Really?\" I didn't really think of men as nurses but I guess they existed, why not?\n\n\"Aren't you going to laugh, Andy does?\"\n\n\"Why, people laugh at me for majoring in recreation but it suits me. If nursing suits you, who cares. I bet you are really good at your job.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" his smile got even bigger and he beat his hands on the steering wheel once and straightened up. \"We should park as close as we can. It's getting late and your legs aren't up for walking far.\"\n\nMiraculously, we managed to get a place not too far from the building, and we walked as quickly as my pain would allow to the recital hall in the basement. Sneaking in just after the opening prayer, we found two seats at the back. Melissa was beautiful and her silver flute shined against her black satin dress. She and the other performers were really good. I looked over at Mark during one song to find that he had his eyes closed. Had he fallen asleep? I certainly couldn't blame him for that. Maybe late night movies were not a good idea for this crowd. I watched a smile spread across his lips and his fingers moved in time with the music tapping on his leg. He was awake, he was just enjoying.\n\nI really wanted to give Melissa a hug after the performance but she was swept away by a crowd as soon as the closing prayer was over. I would see her at home and congratulate her there. Mark and I left quietly.\n\n\"Andy's really going to be sorry that he had to work tonight.\" Mark said as we drove toward home.\n\n\"Yeah, Melissa was great. Does he really likes music?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I think he would have just liked hanging out with you.\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah. Because I have been such a fun person to be around with my sunburn and everything,\"\n\n\"I enjoyed it.\"\n\nI laughed, \"Well you are just easy to please, then. It must come from being such a perfect brother. Where does Andy work?\"\n\n\"He's a waiter in a little restaurant downtown. He works most Saturday nights.\" We pulled into our parking lot.\n\n\"Thank you so much for the ride and the aloe. It was fun to have someone to hang out with at the concert. I'll see you tomorrow for church?\"\n\n\"Yep. Megan, wait!\" he hollered after me as I walked off toward my apartment. \"Did you forget something?\" I looked at him trying to remember what I was forgetting. \"Your bike?\"\n\n\"Oops, I'm doing really well today,\" I said feeling a little embarrassed.\n\n\"You do seem kind of distracted. Something up?\"\n\n\"Truthfully, yes... but it's kind of private,\" I admitted. Mark was really a sweetheart but he didn't need to worry about my problems.\n\nMark carried my bike over to the bike rack and I locked it up. \"Let me know if you change your mind,\" he said supportively. \"And make sure you drink lots of water, with that burn you could get dehydrated.\"\n\n\"You're just awesome, Mark. Thanks.\" I walked into the quiet apartment and went to take a shower. Maybe if I kept the water cool enough it wouldn't hurt too badly. When I was done I applied the aloe again, it felt so much better already. I was sticky and stiff when the front door opened and I heard a large group of people entering. Maybe some of the crowd had followed them home. Listening more closely. I was sure that I heard male voices in the mix. I'd better congratulate her later since I was already dressed for bed.\n\nI laid on my bed and read my scriptures for a while, and then I checked my email. There it was, the email from my mom. My appointment was with a Dr. Warrenbach at 3 pm on Tuesday. The map to the oncology clinic showed that it was close enough that I could ride my bike. There was no need to ask anyone for a ride so no one would have to know about it. What a relief, now my mom and I would be the only ones stressing over this.\n\nAfter about an hour, I heard the sounds of several people leaving. Melissa's voice got louder. \"Yeah! It's over!\" I stuck my head out and didn't see anyone so I tiptoed down the hall. Kristen, Melissa, and Jackie were chatting.\n\n\"Your performance was wonderful, Melissa,\" I said as I walked into view.\n\n\"Megan, where were you?\" Kristen asked, exasperation clear on her face.\n\n\"Long story. I made it to the concert but I was just a little under dressed so we left right after. It really was good. You were so beautiful.\"\n\n\"Thanks. You know Kristen, Jackie... I was just thinking that I was in the mood for a long story and that 'we' intrigues me.\"\n\nI scrunched my face not really wanting to share my story and Jackie giggled. With a sigh I said, \"Okay, scoot over. Is there any of that ice cream left?\"\n\n\"Freezer.\" Kristen said pointing.\n\n\"Don't get up, start talking and I'll get it.\" Jackie said jumping up with her usual enthusiasm.\n\n\"Really it isn't a very interesting story.\" They all looked at me expectantly anyway so I began. \"I rode my bike out to Utah Lake today. I had plenty of time and the weather was so nice. I guess last night caught up with me and I fell asleep. I didn't wake up until 6:30. Knowing that I couldn't make it in time, I called Mark and he came to get me. He was really nice about it and was happy to stay for your concert too. He'll probably mention it tomorrow,\" I said looking at Melissa. \"Anyway he brought me home, oh and he bought me some aloe for my sunburn. That's really all there is.\"\n\nThree sets of eyes were staring at me as if they could wring something more out of my story. Jackie's seemed to be smiling as if she knew something. \"Sunburn?\" Kristen asked.\n\n\"I guess I left that part out. Well, I fell asleep in the sun, you know, it happens. I burned the back of my neck and the back of my legs. The aloe is helping though.\"\n\n\"That was really nice of Mark,\" Jackie smirked. I remembered then that I had suspected something between them. I was completely confused when she asked, \"Are you guys going out again?\"\n\n\"What? We weren't on a date. He just came to my rescue.\"\n\n\"Sure.\" Three voices echoed back at me and I added three to my smile total bringing the final tally of the week to 51.\nChapter 3\n\nThe next day, I was carefully lowered into Andy's front seat. He held my hand in an effort to ease my descent into the car and allow me to keep my legs straighter. I was starting to feel a little silly about things. \"Really, I'm fine,\" I protested. \"It's just a sunburn. The aloe worked wonders. I can barely feel it this morning.\"\n\nJackie was smirking from the back seat at me, again. I wanted to stick my tongue out at her but I didn't want to have to explain it to Andy. She could see romance everywhere. It was so annoying. Andy kept looking over at me as he drove. \"You're really quiet today. Are you sure you feel okay?\"\n\n\"I'm just tired, I guess. I have a busy week ahead of me.\" And a horribly worrisome one; I hated these appointments. I kind of missed having Spencer to talk too. I couldn't just drop a word like cancer into the conversation with my new friends and expect them not to freak out. Spencer knew how to treat it like nothing and that made it so much easier.\n\nHe nodded, \"Sure. I'm sorry I missed last night. I would have loved to help you out.\"\n\nWe located everyone and found a section in the lecture hall big enough for all of us. If we added anyone else to our group, we would probably have to leave a little earlier for church. Jackie brought her friend Alisha over to sit with us. It was enjoyable to sit in my chair before church began listening to the whispered giggles and watching Jackie and Alisha look longingly at our male companions. The guys did look nice in their Sunday outfits. Nathan had a talent for picking snazzy ties. I wondered briefly if it was his sister Emily's taste or his.\n\nI was sitting in between Jackie and Andy. Mark and Nathan were seated on Andy's other side. Mark leaned forward so that he could speak to me. \"How are you feeling today?\"\n\n\"I'm good. How are you?\"\n\nHe jokingly puffed out his chest. \"Still as perfect as ever, thanks. Did you remember to drink?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mom,\" I mocked through a tight lipped smile. It was thoughtful, I guess, for him to check but I was worried he could see through me. It made me want to hide.\n\n\"How is the burn? Hold up your hair so I can see.\" I made a big O with my mouth and covered it with my hand. Humor usually worked as a distraction.\n\n\"Right here in church? Mark, please.\"\n\nHe rolled his eyes at me then wiggled his eyebrows. How does he do that? I have always wanted to wiggle my eyebrows. \"I could have asked to see your legs.\" He was good at this humor thing too. I laughed and collected my first smile of the week. Andy squirmed a little in his seat, we must be embarrassing him.\n\nI held my hair up without further comment for Mark's inspection. \"Good, it does look lighter today, no blistering.\" He seemed satisfied and leaned back in his seat. I lowered my hair just as the prelude music ended.\n\n* * *\n\nI accepted an invitation to have dinner at D41 before the ward fireside\n\nthat night. Eating dinner with John, Mark, Andy, and Nathan was almost familiar now. John even seemed to be relaxing a bit around me. He at least was seeing me as one of the guys.\n\n\"I didn't know you could cook, it was delicious, thanks.\" I offered as I carried my plate to the sink.\n\nAndy smiled, \"Anyone can make spaghetti. You should try my fried chicken.\"\n\n\"Sounds good; I'm here the next time you make it,\" I said, shamelessly inviting myself.\n\n\"In that case, I will make it next week.\" He spoke with a broad smile. That was smile number eleven already this today.\n\nWe still had a little while until the fireside so together we did the dishes. The other roommates scattered. Mark was on the phone taking care of the call he had missed with his sister yesterday. Nathan and John were in the living room reading scriptures.\n\n\"So is your sunburn really okay?\" Andy asked craning his neck to see the back of mine. I lifted my hair, leaving some dish soap bubbles in my curls.\n\n\"Yes, I'm fine. I just feel kind of silly that you guys are making such a fuss about it.\"\n\n\"You shouldn't, that's what we're here for. I wish I hadn't been working, I probably would have been on that ride with you.\"\n\n\"Oh, then we both would have needed a ride.\"\n\n\"Nope, you never would have fallen asleep because I am very entertaining.\" He winked and reached to put a plate away in the cupboard. Smile number twelve; my totals were going to be really high hanging out with this crowd.\n\n\"Megan,\" he began, and then paused drying another plate. He looked at me and I almost got the giggles because his face was so pained. \"I was hoping that you would go out with me this Friday. My friend Rachel's ward is having a dance.\"\n\nI wasn't sure what to say, Andy was great. I hoped that he knew how much I liked him. I just didn't want to mess up the whole friendship thing. Apartment D41 had become my home away from home. For a small eternity, I pondered all the possibilities. How harmful could a date really be? Before I knew it, years of seeking smiles took over and I blurted out, \"Sure, sounds like fun.\"\n\nThe answering smile, number 13, was worth the butterflies in my stomach.\n\n\"Great, I'll get the details to you later in the week.\" I handed him a clean pot and he dried it with the towel. What had just happened? I had an actual date. That had never happened before.\n\nMark emerged from the hallway closing his phone. His eyes scanned the room and he looked straight at me. \"Oh, Megan, I'm glad you're still here; I need a girl's opinion.\"\n\n\"Step into my office. How can I help?\" I said gesturing towards to table. \"By the way, advice is five cents.\"\n\n\"Can I run a tab?\"\n\n\"Anything for my rescuer.\"\n\nAndy cleared his throat behind me and then sat down next to me at the table. \"Let's get to the point already. What's up Mark?\"\n\nI was suddenly worried that I was going to have to give him advice on his love life. I may be a girl but I was clueless when it came to that topic.\n\n\"Rebekah is coming for a visit.\"\n\nAndy pulled his shirt away from his neck with one finger as if he were feeling over heated and said, \"Really, when? I'm finally going to get to meet her in person. Do you think I have time to plan a trip somewhere?\"\n\n\"Hey, that's my sister you are talking about.\" The indignation on Mark's face didn't quite reach his laughing eyes.\n\nFinally, I understood enough to jump in to the conversation. \"Oh, Rebekah is your sister. Awesome! When is she coming and how can I help? And why is Andy feeling nervous? Does he like her?\"\n\n\"Of course not!\" Andy blurted out a little louder than he needed to.\n\n\"Hey, could you keep it down over there,\" Nathan hollered from the couch.\n\n\"Sorry,\" we chorused.\n\nMark was squinting at Andy, \"He'd better not like her.\"\n\n\"I don't. She is the one who wrote me, remember?\"\n\n\"Oooh, this sounds good.... Details, please.\"\n\n\"There isn't much to tell really. Mark's sister is totally boy crazy and wrote not only letters to him but to every companion he had on his mission.\"\n\nMark was now sitting with his head in his hands. It was an unusual posture for him. \"So how old is this sister, Mark?\"\n\n\"Sixteen, and Andy's right; she is really boy crazy.\"\n\nI couldn't help but laugh at their discomfort. It was cute in a way. \"So let's see, you have a perfectly normal teenage sister and this distresses you? Well, no worries. She will only be here a short time and I doubt she is so quick that she will find and marry some guy on campus. Though, this is BYU and we are kind of known for fast romances. Andy, here, might even be swept away by the girl who so faithfully wrote him.\" Mark groaned and Andy protested while I giggled.\n\nAs my laughter died down, I began to sense that the mood was much more serious. Mark had not put his head up yet. Had I touched on some deep rooted worries?\n\n\"Mark, I'm sorry. I was just teasing. Rebekah is going to be just fine. She will have a great visit and we will keep Andy away from her.\" I turned and winked at Andy who didn't seem to be enjoying the joke either. \"Sorry,\" I mouthed to him.\n\nI reached between Mark's arm and head with my hand. I found his chin and forced it up. He responded by resting it on his stacked fists. His mouth still seemed thoughtful, almost frowning but his eyes were dancing again. \"So, what's the plan, Megan?\"\n\n\"Well, what does she like to do? There are a ton of things we can do but it's kind of up to her.\"\n\n\"I'm not really sure. We haven't spent a lot of time together over the past few years. Aside from the boy thing, which I don't think we should encourage, I'm at a loss.\"\n\n\"Mark, you are one of the most devoted brothers I have ever seen. I don't believe that you don't know your own sister.\"\n\n\"Sure, I know her but that doesn't mean I know what she wants to do.\"\n\n\"Tell me about her, maybe we can figure it out. What kind of music does she like? Does she play any sports? What's her favorite subject in school? Does she want to go to school here?\"\n\n\"Can I think about it little bit? I can answer some of those questions but I think for tonight I just needed to know that you would help me.\"\n\n\"No problem. I am excited to meet her.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Megan, you are the best.\" Once again, my smile tally increased. Mark gave me a big bear hug as I got up from my chair. It threw my balance off just enough and he had to grab me even tighter to keep me from falling. I could feel the answering chuckle resonate in his chest.\n\n\"I'm going to go and get the girls now,\" I said when he finally let go.\n\n\"I'll come with you.\" Andy wrapped his arm around my shoulder and walked me to the door. When we were outside, he said, \"It is really nice of you to help Mark. He gets so obsessed about his family sometimes. I'm glad you talked him down.\"\n\n\"I think it's great that he cares so much.\"\n\n\"Great, and a bit debilitating. You should have seen him on our mission.\"\n\n\"Was it that bad?\"\n\n\"Oh, he was a great missionary but he worried a lot.\"\n\n\"Well, he won't have to worry about this visit. We will make sure Rebekah has the best time.\"\n\n\"You'll make sure. I, for one, will be laying low. I wasn't kidding about the boy crazy thing.\"\n\n\"Are you really afraid of a 16 year old girl?\"\n\n\"Afraid, no. Terrified, yes. Especially since no matter what I do Mark will be watching me looking for hidden meaning. But Megan, I swear, I have no interest in his sister. You believe me right?\"\n\nI bumped my arm against his and gave him my most innocent smile. \"Sure, I believe you.\"\n\n\"No really! This is so infuriating. Fine, I know how to make you believe me.\" He stopped me, placed his hands on my shoulders, and turned me towards him. \"I like the one who I asked out for Friday night \u2013 and have since I first saw her.\"\n\nMy face felt hot and I tried swallowing but there was something big in my throat blocking it. He relaxed his hands and let me go. \"Understand?\" I nodded mutely. \"Okay, let's go get your roommates.\"\n\n* * *\n\nMonday night I got my weekly text from Spencer's mom, reporting his total. It was a system we'd worked out before he left so that I could continue to keep records for us. He'd had a pretty good week with a total of 67. His were probably a lot harder to get than mine were. I thought my tally had been pretty good this last week. I took a moment to recall some of the more breath taking smiles. It was like my new friends were helping me on purpose, but they didn't know about my little collection.\n\nAfter FHE group, I sat down to write Spencer a letter. It had been a while and I'd been thinking of him a lot lately. I wish I had him to tell me what to think of Andy's confessions. I wished I had him to distract me from my doctor appointment. It was just so wrong that he was gone so far away when I needed him so much. I was half way through a sheet of paper when I realized I was angry with him and it was definitely showing in my letter.\n\nI took a deep breath and crumpled the paper up. It wasn't his fault that he was across the world when I needed someone to talk to, but it still felt like it. I sat at the kitchen table feeling guilty for being mad and even guiltier for feeling bad about him serving the Lord. The real problem was that I didn't want to go to my appointment. I didn't want to be sick anymore and I definitely did not want to be looked on with pity, so telling anyone else about it was right out.\n\nI buried the wasted paper in the trash, ashamed that I had expressed such negative feelings. This bad mood was not really something I wanted to share with anyone so I grabbed my basketball and headed for the courts hoping the guys wouldn't be there. I wasn't really up for seeing them. Why did these appointments have to turn me into such an angry person? I didn't like myself when I felt that way.\n\nThe next day I sat in the doctor's waiting room and tried the letter again. I was aiming for light and uplifting, and somehow focusing on the lighter side of things made my letter and my surroundings better. I reported my smile total to him and gave him a brief description of the guys that I spent so much of my time with these days. By the time the nurse called me back to the room, I had managed a supportive, upbeat, and positive three page letter.\n\nThat night after dinner, I grabbed my cell and went for a walk. I still had to report to my mom and I didn't want anyone to overhear. The doctor's visit had been almost nothing with just a bunch of questions and a quick exam.\n\nI still had to go for a couple of tests after my Thursday classes. My mom was reassured as I told her Dr. Warrenbach was nice, and that he had read all through my files before I even arrived. I didn't tell her that he'd told me I could leave her off of my privacy list and she wouldn't be able to get my test results anymore. I hadn't seriously considered it but I enjoyed a few wicked moments thinking about it.\n\nAfter I gave the necessary report and promised to go for the tests like a good girl, I asked her about the wedding plans. I knew that this would distract her from what I didn't want to tell her about the appointment, and I was right.\n\nLindsey seemed to be driving my mom nuts with picky little details. My mom disagreed with the color and flower choices. I was trying to find the best way to remind her that it was Lindsey's and George's wedding when she sighed. \"Well it is their wedding, I guess I can deal with burgundy. I still think pink would be an easier color to work with.\"\n\n\"Don't worry Mom, you will survive this. Just think, you only have four weddings left after this.\"\n\n\"That's if all of you get married. I'm not so sure about Drew some days, he's so quiet.\"\n\n\"Speaking of which, I have an actual date this weekend. Can you believe it?\"\n\n\"A real date, not some group thing?\"\n\n\"Yes, a real date; he asked me and everything.\" My stomach did a flip flop as I recalled his confession.\n\n\"Well, I want a report on that, too. You can tell me when you call with your test results.\"\n\n\"Mom, I don't think they'll have the results back by this weekend.\"\n\n\"That's okay, I can wait... but I do expect to hear from you. Oops, got to go. Dinner is burning.\"\n\n\"Okay, Mom. Bye.\" I was saved by the scorched lasagna. Not that I wouldn't have to go through it all again this weekend. I needed to learn to keep my mouth shut. At least I had managed not to tell her that the doctor had ordered more tests because he was concerned about something he had felt while examining me. She would find out if she needed to and if it was nothing, then she wouldn't have to worry.\n\nI was doing enough worrying for both of us. It was really probably nothing, and if it was something, it wasn't as if I hadn't been through it before.\n\nI looked up at the mountain as I walked down the streets lined with parked cars. It was really beautiful this time of year, there was the faintest hint of fall color popping up here and there. Turning towards home, I planned out what homework I would do first. If I was going to be gone Thursday and busy over the weekend, I should get it done now; besides, it would be a good distraction.\n\nMy mind only lingered on my studies for a moment before I started to wonder about Friday. I hadn't really seen Andy since Sunday and I was still processing. He'd been very serious when he said he liked me, I was sure of that. Did he want me to say it back? What was I supposed to do? I wondered what you did with a date at a dance. Was Andy a good dancer? Was I? Whether we could dance well or not we were sure to have fun. Andy was always so upbeat. I was really starting to look forward to the date. Maybe I would like dating. This week I was sure to beat Spencer's total.\n\nHome was almost in sight but my mind kept hopping from subject to subject driven by my intense desire to forget the one thing I couldn't face, at least not anymore tonight. Maybe Jackie would want to go get some ice cream or the guys might be on the courts; homework could wait.\n\nThursday I endured the tests. Like always, I tried to get the ultrasound tech to tell me what she was seeing but of course, she said nothing. It had never worked, but that didn't stop me from trying. As uncomfortable as the tests were, I found waiting for the results much more difficult. As distractions went, the date with Andy couldn't have been timed any better. I just needed to get through the next few days and it would all be over. I found being nervous about my first date felt a lot better than worrying over medical tests, so I focused all my attention towards Friday night.\n\nIn order to keep that focus I elected not to carry my cell phone with me. If Mom called, she would want to talk about the tests. I was sure if she had a spare moment she wouldn't be able to resist checking up on me so Friday the cell stayed on the charger. Sure, I could just not answer her calls but if I didn't know about them, I would feel less guilty.\n\nI didn't even think about checking the caller ID when I answered the phone on Friday afternoon. \"Good afternoon, this is Megan speaking.\"\n\n\"Well, good afternoon to you too. You sound like you are in a good mood.\"\n\n\"Dad?\"\n\n\"Yep, I heard through the grapevine that you have an official date tonight.\"\n\nI smirked thinking of all the times he had promised to torment my dates when they picked me up; he had never gotten the chance. \"That's right, shocking isn't it?\"\n\n\"Not really, I knew all the boys in the world couldn't be stupid. It just took you a while to find a smart bunch. Anyway, since I can't be there I want to know all about this guy...Wait, no, I trust your judgment. Just tell me, is he nice to you?\"\n\n\"Well, we haven't been out yet,\" I reminded him, \"but he is always cool when we hang out.\"\n\n\"Okay, just remember it's his privilege to go out with you so you don't have to do anything you don't want to.\"\n\n\"Gee, thanks Dad. I so did not want to go there.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"Yeah, okay, I can drop it. I know you can hold your own. Hey, do me a favor?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Don't forget to give your mom an update; some of us still have to live with her.\" I could hear the smile in his voice. In my mind, I could picture his beaming face so clearly that I counted it.\n\n\"Okay, but I can't promise she'll be satisfied. Hey, I love you but I've got things to do before tonight.\"\n\n\"I'll let you go. Love you too, Megan. Bye.\"\n\nAfter Dad's call there didn't seem to be much use in not carrying my cell, so I took it and my laundry to the central laundry room. I planned to multi task and give reminder calls to the sisters in my visiting teaching district as I waited. Visiting teaching wasn't my favorite thing but I had accepted the call to be a supervisor and I was going to do my best.\n\nMost of the sisters I called seemed to feel the same way about visiting teaching that I did. My own visiting teachers hadn't visited yet. I couldn't really complain. I had only half-heartedly spent a few minutes with the two sisters that I was assigned to visit. I didn't even really share a lesson, just a quick scripture from the message. I hadn't even called my companion.\n\nI hung up with the last sister on my list. Hopefully the reminder would improve the numbers because they weren't looking very good yet. I moved my laundry over to the dryer and thought about my calling again. Mom seemed to like visiting teaching, so what did she know that I didn't?\n\nGeneral Women's Conference\n\nwas this weekend. I said a silent prayer asking Heavenly Father to help me be prepared for His messages, adding a special request for a greater understanding of visiting teaching. I always tried to go into conference with a question and usually my answer would come in one way or another. This conference I really needed some help. If I was going to motivate the girls on my list, motivation should probably come to me too. I finished my prayer and found that I felt peaceful. It was so nice to just sit and enjoy the feeling.\nChapter 4\n\nI watched my roommates buzz around the apartment. Kristen had a big date with Tony. Melissa was following her around with a can of hairspray. The two girls had been friends since high school so the probably had a routine down.\n\nJackie was in our room studying. There was more going on with her than just the domestic stuff and boys. She was really smart and spent a lot of time on her studies.\n\nI remembered my own pressing homework. I opened my history textbook that was sitting on the table next to me and tried to focus but I was starting to feel nervous. After I'd reread the same sentence over four times, I closed the book.\n\nWhat was wrong with me? It was just a dance. I had been to dozens, and it was only Andy after all. We were friends. I'd done lots of things with him over the last few weeks. Then I remembered that he wanted to be more than friends and my knees began to bounce up and down under the table.\n\nJackie hopped into the room. \"So, are you just so excited?!!\" It wasn't really a question. Her eyes were alight with a manic energy.\n\n\"I guess so, I'm kind of nervous.\"\n\n\"You? You're the one that always seems so confident around boys. I can't believe you're nervous.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not really used to dating.\"\n\nShe seemed surprised by that. \"Megan, I wish I had half your guts.\"\n\n\"I wish I had them now, too,\" I smiled at her. Things just seemed a lot more serious now that Andy said he liked me. I liked him too, but was it enough or in the right way?\n\n\"You should get ready; it's about 6:30.\"\n\n\"Oh, I have time. I just need to run a brush through my hair and slip a dress on.\"\n\n\"Megan! You really don't have a clue. Come with me.\" She dragged me from the chair and led me down the hall to our room. \"Now put your dress on so that we can fix your hair.\"\n\n\"Really, it's no big deal.\" This was my last line of defense. If I treated it just like any other outing with Andy, maybe I wouldn't feel so nervous that I wanted to vomit.\n\n\"Come on, it will be fun. Let me play dress up.\"\n\n\"Okay, but I'm warning you, my hair is impossible.\" Her answering smile had me sold on letting her help. If it was going to make her that happy, I could endure a little fussing over.\n\nShe made me try two dresses, then gave up and went into my closet. She emerged with a dress I hardly wore, because it wasn't as comfortable as my jumpers were.\n\n\"Meet me in the bathroom and don't take too long.\"\n\nThe first few attempts to tame my naturally bushy hair failed. Jackie was getting discouraged.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" I said, \"simple works for me.\" She settled for clipping the sides of my hair back at the top of my head.\n\n\"Don't you have any make-up?\"\n\n\"I don't really wear much.\"\n\n\"Wait here. I will go get mine and I think some different earrings too.\"\n\nShe was off fishing around in our room when the doorbell rang. Sighing in relief, I headed down the hallway and called back to Jackie. \"Thanks, but he's here. Have a good night.\"\n\nI opened the door to a smiling face. That made two in the last half hour. \"Hi, Andy.\"\n\n\"Hi. You look beautiful.\" He handed me a yellow rose tied with a white ribbon. This was the first time I'd gotten flowers when I wasn't sick.\n\n\"Thank you, it smells so good.\" I inhaled and left the door open, gesturing for him to enter. I went to the kitchen, found a vase for the rose, and left it on the counter where we could all see it.\n\n\"Ready to go?\"\n\n\"Yes, where is the dance?\"\n\n\"It's just up the hill a bit. It's a nice night but I thought we would drive.\"\n\nHe led me to his little Metro that was probably as old as I was. The inside was spotless, the vinyl freshly cleaned and the floor vacuumed. I'd ridden in Andy's car before. It was never this clean. I realized that he had gone to the extra effort for me and it made me feel special. \"So, where do you know Rachel from?\"\n\n\"She's from my home stake in California.\"\n\n\"That's right, you're from California. What part?\"\n\n\"I live in the LA area.\"\n\n\"Big City boy, huh?\"\n\n\"Yep, cities are not a problem for me,\" he said with a note of friendly arrogance. \"But you should have seen poor Mark in Atlanta. He was really out of his depth.\"\n\n\"Not much for big cities?\"\n\n\"No, you and I are much more able to deal with lots of people.\"\n\n\"Exactly how many people are going to be at this dance?\" I asked, surprised by the way the conversation was going.\n\n\"Oh, don't worry about that. It's just a normal dance.\" We parked and Andy ran around to get my door. \"Are you ready?\"\n\n\"Sure let's go!\" I said enthusiastically.\n\nThe dance was well attended, but the crowd wasn't huge. With all those bodies dancing, it was extra warm in the gym. Andy led me to a place on the dance floor which was just under an air vent. I really appreciated the extra air flow because as it turned out Andy loved to dance. We were out on the floor the entire first hour. It had been a long time since I'd danced so much and I realized I was kind of out of shape.\n\nFinally, I asked. \"Andy, could we sit down for a bit, I'm feeling tired.\"\n\nAndy reacted quickly looking around for a couple of seats together. Placing his arm around my shoulders, he guided me out of the gym into a foyer. The sound of the music was much quieter here and it was much cooler. The foyer was surprisingly empty.\n\n\"Hope this is okay, I didn't see many seats in there.\"\n\n\"This is great,\" I said, collapsing onto the couch rather more dramatically than I had meant to.\n\nHe laughed, \"Why didn't you say something sooner?\"\n\n\"I was a little embarrassed and I was having fun.\" I counted another smile.\n\n\"I'm glad you're having fun. I am too.\"\n\n\"I didn't realize you were such a party animal.\"\n\n\"I'm just happy because I'm with you. Normally, I hold the walls up at these things.\"\n\n\"I find that hard to believe. You seemed to know what you were doing out there.\"\n\n\"When I was a youth, we all used to just get out and dance. We never really did the boy/girl pairing thing. It would be too weird because we all felt like brothers and sisters.\"\n\n\"Sounds fun. My ward paired off a bit more, but I had friends like that in high school. My best friend, Spencer, is on a mission now in France.\"\n\n\"France, that's a long way from Atlanta.\"\n\n\"It's a long way from Provo, too. I miss him sometimes. We practically grew up together.\"\n\nAndy looked around. \"Are you thirsty? I'm going to get us something to drink. Wait here.\"\n\nI smiled at him and he hurried back into the gym. I took advantage of his absence to remove my shoes and stretch my feet. My toes didn't like my dress shoes much, and they weren't real happy about all the dancing, either.\n\nThings were going pretty well. I liked Andy a lot. He was full of energy and he was so sweet to me. But he was sweet to everyone. I couldn't tell if he was treating me differently or not. Thinking about it too much was liable to terrify me, so I tapped my feet to the music instead and waited for Andy to return.\n\nWhen he sauntered into the room, he had cookies in a napkin and two glasses of some light colored punch. He handed me a glass and then sat next to me spreading the napkin with the cookies on his lap.\n\n\"Those look yummy. Can I have one?\"\n\n\"You can have as many as you want.\"\n\nI grabbed a cookie and we both munched away in silence for a few minutes.\n\n\"Your cookies tasted better,\" he complimented.\n\n\"Learning how to make cookies was just a matter of survival in my house, but I wish I could cook like you.\"\n\n\"It's not hard, you'll get there.\"\n\n\"Maybe but I'm wishing I'd had my mom show me more while I was home.\"\n\n\"Tell me about your family. You're from Arizona right?\"\n\n\"Yes, my family lives in Mesa. I was born here, though. Dad was still in law school then.\"\n\nHe made an encouraging noise through the mouth full of cookie and I continued. \"I have an older brother who is about your age. He just got engaged to a girl from our home ward. George is an engineering major at ASU. Then after me come the twins, Matt and Drew. Drew is short for Andrew, that's your name right?\" He nodded and popped another cookie in his mouth. \"Well, the twins are 16 now and busy with jobs and school. Then Kelly is the youngest and my only sister, she's 11. She's way into dance and is a lot more graceful than I am.\"\n\n\"You were dancing gracefully.\"\n\n\"That's nice of you to say, but I don't think that I believe you. Are you ready to dance again?\"\n\n\"Don't be silly, dancing is fun but this way we can talk.\" He casually rested his hand on my shoulder and looked into my eyes with an intent gaze that made me feel shy. \"I had an evening study session and haven't had dinner yet. Do you want to go get something to eat?\"\n\n\"Still hungry after all those cookies?\" I said, looking at the empty napkin.\n\nHe looked guilty. \"Did you want some more? I could go get you some.\"\n\n\"No, I'm fine. I think we had better get you some proper food before you eat every cookie in sight.\" He hopped up off the couch and took my hand, pulling me enthusiastically to my feet.\n\n\"Dinner it is.\" Again, he led me out to the car with his hand around my shoulders and I was beginning to like the way it felt. Maybe I didn't need to try to feel something, maybe it would just come naturally.\n\nWe talked about classes and he gave me a few pointers for my finance class. It was fun to be out and it wasn't hard at all to talk to Andy. I already knew that we got along great. It seemed silly to be so nervous and yet it felt different.\n\nLiving with brothers had prepared me for the amount of food he managed to scarf down. I was used to such displays. I was a bit hungry after all the dancing, but I only nibbled at my food, trying to avoid getting sauce on my dress.\n\nHis eyes seemed to sparkle when he talked and it felt like they were sparkling just for me. It was an unusual feeling but the longer we were together the more shy I felt. There was a strange feeling in my stomach. With luck, he wouldn't notice that I had stopped talking and was just giving him encouraging nods as he talked about his mission and his home life.\n\nHe was hoping to do marketing for one of the big animation companies when he graduated. I learned that he was a bit of an artist. I managed to come out of my shyness enough to ask him to show me his work sometime. He seemed pleased that I was interested and then his eyes sparkled again and I was silent.\n\nI was a little glad when we stood to go home. This new silence of mine was making me feel like I was being completely stupid and making things weird. Where was my long list of silly jokes or my easy banter about sports? He seemed not to notice and continued on talking about plans and fun dates he had been on.\n\nOne time he had taken Rachel to the prom and they had gotten lost trying to find the location. His musing lasted the ride home with little encouragement from me and I was grateful that he was so at ease. Obviously, this was not his first date and I suspected that experience was on his side.\n\nHe walked me to my door. \"Thanks. I had a really fun time.\"\n\nHe leaned over and kissed my cheek. \"Me, too. Can you go out next Friday?\"\n\n\"Yes. What do you want to do?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure yet. We can talk more later.\" He smiled a wide grin. Dating was going to do wonders for my totals. Tonight alone I had collected eleven big smiles.\n\n\"See you tomorrow.\"\n\nI walked into the living room and Jackie pounced. \"So, how was it? Are you going out again? Did he kiss you? I saw your rose. Oh, how sweet!\" She squealed and jumped around. Jackie should have come with us then she could have danced some of that energy out and I wouldn't have to tell her everything that happened.\n\nI tried to gather my scattered thoughts because I just realized that I was apparently dating Andy. \"I had a really good time; he's a great dancer.\"\n\n\"Oh, give me all the details.\"\n\n* * *\n\nThe General Women's Broadcast the next day was a good opportunity to spend some time with my roommates. We decided to dress alike so each of us was wearing a black skirt and a solid colored top. Arm and arm we entered the Marriot Center to watch the broadcast. With our matched outfits, we looked a bit like choir members. We felt more like a large group of young women than we did Relief Society sisters, but somewhere in the last couple of years, we had crossed that threshold.\n\nI listened intently for any help with my questions about visiting teaching. Both the General Relief Society counselors talked about visiting teaching but somehow the words failed to instill in me an instant love of the program. Perhaps, I wasn't in tune enough or maybe my answers would come during general conference.\n\nAfter the broadcast, we began a new tradition and like most of our traditions, it involved food. By the time the frozen pie baked and cooled enough to eat, it was very late. We dragged our pillows and blankets out into the living room and had a slumber party.\n\nI'd managed to get about four hours of sleep before we got up for church. I think I had more sleep than the others did, especially Jackie who takes at least an hour to get ready in the morning.\n\n* * *\n\nSunday morning our usual rides were waiting for us; the only difference was that Andy casually held my hand as we walked from the parking lot into church. He seemed to be smiling more than usual and I was much quieter. I wasn't sure if these were the kind of smiles I could count, but they seemed to be for me.\n\nWe had just sat down and started to listen to the prelude when Andy hopped back up. \"I have to go take care of some Elder's Quorum business, I'll be right back.\"\n\n\"Okay, don't forget to be in your seat when it's time to start,\" I reminded him. Our bishop was a stickler for starting on time and we'd had the lecture several times.\n\n\"No worries. I'll hurry.\"\n\nWith Andy gone it was easy to talk to Mark who sat in the seat on Andy's other side. \"Hey, I wanted to tell you that everything is set for Rebekah staying with us. Everyone is really excited to be entertaining, actually.\"\n\nMark sighed, \"That's great. I will call her right after church. I've told her all about you. She is anxious to see for herself.\" Mark wiggled his eyebrows jokingly as he spoke.\n\n\"Great, is she expecting me to have a third eye or something?\"\n\n\"Not exactly, I told her you were the life of the party.\"\n\n\"I don't think I can live up to that expectation. It's not like I am an endless supply of fun ideas.\"\n\n\"No, it's just that you make things fun no matter what we're doing.\"\n\nThat was a nice compliment. I grinned and added his return smile to my tally. \"So when is she coming again?\"\n\n\"A week from Thursday, I can't wait. My dad has to come for some meetings in Salt Lake and she is tagging along.\"\n\n\"Your Dad will be here too?\"\n\n\"No. He has to stay in Salt Lake. I'm picking Rebekah up Thursday afternoon and returning her Saturday night. Hey, you should come with me. I'm sure Rebekah would love it and you can meet my dad.\"\n\nI was curious but I didn't want to intrude. \"Are you sure? It sounds like a family thing.\"\n\n\"Absolutely. When are you done with Thursday classes?\"\n\n\"About 2:00.\"\n\n\"Perfect, call as soon as you get home and we will go.\"\n\n\"You'll probably need to remind me as it gets closer.\"\n\nMark and I were leaning towards each other so that we would not have to speak too loud. Andy squeezed down the row and sat back down. \"What did I miss?\"\n\n\"Just plans for Rebekah's visit,\" Mark said shrugging his shoulders.\n\nOn the way home Andy said, \"I was thinking about our date Friday. How about dinner? I could take you where I work. The food is really good. It's the best place in town if you like Mexican food.\"\n\n\"That sounds yummy. I miss Mexican food, it's a favorite.\"\n\n\"Great, so Friday at 6:00?\" I nodded and looked out the window. I wasn't quite used to this, yet. \"You are coming over for dinner tonight right?\"\n\n\"I am?\"\n\n\"Did you forget? I'm making my fried chicken.\"\n\n\"That's right. Should I bring anything?\"\n\n\"Just some games.\"\n\nIn the couple of hours I had between church and dinner, I panicked. Dating was new and Andy was new and my old troubles were circling above and threatening to land on my head. What if I really had relapsed? How could I tell Andy or Jackie or any of my new friends? What would they think when I was sick all the time and no fun? What would they think when I lost my hair? Could I even stay at school or would I have to go home? Worries and fears circled and circled until I was too exhausted to care about the answers. I wiped the tears from my eyes, splashed my face with cold water and went to dinner.\n\n\"This was so good. You really know how to cook.\" So many talents it hardly seemed fair.\n\n\"Yeah, it made him pretty popular in the mission too.\" Mark said gathering the dishes.\n\n\"There are only so many ways you can cook macaroni and cheese though.\" Andy said, picking up the Pictionary game from the stack on the coffee table.\n\n\"We need another player for that,\" I commented.\n\n\"Nathan!\" both Andy and Mark yelled at the same time.\n\nAndy and I were pretty good as Pictionary partners. Nathan was getting a little frustrated at our speed. Mark's drawings weren't very good and Nathan couldn't figure them out. Andy and Mark would probably make great partners, despite Mark's drawing skills, because they knew each other so well. I was going to suggest we divide our teams that way but Nathan wasn't up for losing again.\n\nInstead, I suggested that it would be a good time for Andy to show me some of his artwork. This would give Nathan time to relax and I was curious. Nathan harrumphed down the hall.\n\nAndy returned with his art portfolio. I was not disappointed, it was definitely amazing. He did mostly ink drawings that seemed to come alive on the page. I noticed that he had a little character he drew over and over in his sketch book always doing something different.\n\n\"Who's this little guy?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, that's just a doodle I do to practice different poses.\" He said shrugging.\n\n\"He's cute. You should give him a name.\"\n\n\"What would you name him?\" He asked his eyes sparkling at me.\n\nI tried to think of something clever but gave up. Those green eyes of his just left my mind blank. \"I'll think about it.\"\n\nI thanked Andy again for dinner and said goodnight to the various faces roaming around the apartment: one talking on the phone, one looking through a book and one rummaging in the fridge for something to eat; where did he find the room? I was still stuffed.\n\nWhen I got home, I picked up the Ensign from the table and headed off to bed. I decided to get a head start on October by reading the visiting teaching message early. Then I prayed again for the answer that I was seeking, hoping that Conference would teach me what I needed to know. I pulled up my computer calendar and made a note to call the sisters on my list this week and get their report. Looking at the note for my ultrasound last week, I remembered that I was still waiting for my results. Before I could spiral down into another unhelpful panic attack, I focused on thinking up names for Andy's little character.\n\nDistractions used to work really well but any more, it seemed I was having to step up my game to ignore all that made me feel worried.\n\nI got Spencer's tally on Monday. He must have had a hard week. His 14 was unusual and hardly a match for my 61. I pulled out a card and wrote in it one of my favorite silly jokes. Then I drew a smiley face with its tongue sticking out because I was sure it would make Spencer laugh when he saw it.\n\nWednesday afternoon, the results I had been waiting for came. The nurse called to tell me that both tests had looked normal and the doctor felt he didn't need to see me again for a year. I was relieved that I wouldn't have to think about it for another year; even more relieved than I was that everything was fine. I knew that my mom would need the details soon but I just couldn't face it now. I left my phone in my room and went in search of some fun.\n\nNathan was home and up for a game so we went out to the courts. I managed to beat him once. He was a little grumpy until I told him my secret. \"It's just because I'm a girl.\" I patted his shoulder.\n\nHe grumbled and pulled his shoulder away. \"Emily's a girl too, but I always beat her.\"\n\n\"Yes, but she's your sister and you aren't worried as much about fouling her. Think about it Nathan, weren't you just a little hesitant to get in my way?\"\n\nHe perked up, \"Yeah, that does make a difference. I just wasn't playing very hard.\" He felt better instantly and tossed me the ball. \"How about another game?\"\n\n\"No, thanks. Now that my secret is out, I am pretty sure I'm toast.\"\n\n\"Well at least let me buy the winner a soda or something?\"\n\n\"Okay, that sounds good.\" We walked to the laundry room where there was a soda machine. I opened my root beer and sat on the grass near a tree. The sun was still bright even though it was almost dinner time. Nathan sat next to me and I was surprised that he was in a mood to talk. It was so unlike him.\n\n\"Megan, what do you think of John?\"\n\nI was not expecting this question, I had to think about the answer a second. \"John's great, a little quiet but nice. Why?\"\n\n\"Emily seems pretty interested in him. I just wondered 'cause I don't get it. I mean John is a great bud but Emily is special, you know.\"\n\nWell, well Nathan had unknown depths. \"Emily probably sees special things in John too.\"\n\n\"Yea, but a cowboy? He actually rides a horse and takes care of cattle. Did you know that?\"\n\n\"Are you sure it's John that bothers you or are you just jealous that she wants to spend time with him instead of you?\"\n\nHe looked at me for a long moment and then back down at the grass. \"No comment.\"\n\nI laughed. \"She had to find someone eventually. Aren't you glad it's someone as great as John?\"\n\n\"I still don't like it.\"\n\n\"You are grumpy today aren't you?\"\n\n\"Oh, sorry. I guess I'm not very fun to be with just now.\"\n\nHe screwed his face up into a strange expression and then he started to talk like Donald duck. The drink of root beer that I had just swallowed caught in my throat and I coughed a laugh. Encouraged, Nathan continued. The coughing continued until he paused to see if I was okay. He patted my back and I carefully took a sip to see if I could calm my throat down.\n\nI flopped back on the grass and let the sun warm my face while I tried to breathe deeply. Nathan leaned over me cautiously and quacked, \"Sorry,\" plain as day. I laughed again and hiccupped this time.\n\nIn this mood Nathan was so much like my friend, Spencer, that I couldn't help retaliating. I grabbed a handful of grass and tossed it in his surprised face. Too competitive to let that pass, he grabbed his own handful and instead of tossing it, he ground it into my frizzy hair. How had he found my weakness so quickly? It would take forever to get all that grass out. I reached up and put a handful down the back of his shirt. He jumped up and danced a bit, shaking the grass free. I sat up preparing for the next round.\n\nBut Nathan stopped, \"Okay, uncle.\" I was surprised he had given up so fast. He scratched at his back a little. \"I'm allergic.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. Are you really uncomfortable?\"\n\nI felt the hiccups coming back so I took a big drink of root beer. It was as if Nathan had waited for that exact moment before answering. He let out a loud quacked, \"I'm okay,\" and I spit my root beer across the lawn. He rolled on the ground laughing then started scratching again. \"I'd better go and take a shower. This was fun Megan. Thanks.\" He stood up and left me sitting there with a frustrated look on my face.\n\n\"Yeah, anytime,\" I yelled sarcastically to him as he walked away and he laughed again.\nChapter 5\n\nI went inside to clean up and to call my mom. The medical news was easy enough to report because once she knew I was fine she moved onto my date. I was surprised I didn't get busted for not telling her all the medical details, so I let her pump me for Andy info.\n\nEventually she dragged everything out of me, down to his holding my hand on Sunday. Saying it all out loud had just made it so much more real. It was forty-five minutes later when I convinced her that I needed to eat and do some homework. She was pleased that I was going out with Andy again but I carefully didn't promise a report.\n\n* * *\n\nI cried myself quietly to sleep that night. It was often like this for me when the worry and stress were over. At least I wouldn't have to deal with it for another year.\n\nWhen I had first been diagnosed, it was scary, but I had so many people around me all the time that I never had much time to worry. The doctors were always so optimistic and my friends were always cheering me up. It was a new experience not to have anyone around to talk to about this kind of stuff. I missed Spencer and I started to feel lonely. Maybe I should tell someone here. Now that it was over, they wouldn't have to be worried for me, right?\n\nFriday Andy picked me up in his spotless car again. We drove downtown and he led me to a lowly lit back dining room. Each table was draped with a white table cloth and each had a glowing candle in the center. On one side of the room, there was a balcony with a wrought iron railing. I could see there were four more tables up there.\n\nShadows moved on the walls as the candles flickered in the slight breeze we made as we passed. \"Upstairs, please.\" Andy said placing a strong emphasis on the please. The hostess sighed and held her hand out to the rod iron staircase that led to the balcony. \"Thanks.\" Andy said as he grabbed my hand and led the way to our table.\n\nFrom the balcony, I could see only the far side of the room and it was much quieter. The soft music being piped into the room didn't quite reach us. \"This is so beautiful,\" I said impressed. \"You work here?\"\n\n\"Yep, were lucky to get the balcony. It's a bit of a pain to wait on the tables up here so the hostess tries to avoid them.\"\n\n\"The whole room is beautiful. I don't mind sitting downstairs if it's easier.\"\n\n\"It's fine,\" he assured me. \"I know the waiter who has this station, we're friends. Besides I'll just leave him a big tip; he'll love me. I like how quiet it is up here, don't you?\"\n\nHe was still holding my hand and I felt self-conscious as he gazed into my eyes. I pulled my hand and my eyes away so that I could focus on the menu.\n\n\"Everything looks so good. What's their specialty?\"\n\n\"That's difficult to say but I would definitely try their enchiladas, if I were you; they're incredible.\"\n\n\"That sounds perfect.\" I looked around at the stucco white walls dancing with the glow of the candle flames. \"It even smells good in here.\"\n\n\"Yea, I try not to come to work hungry. It's torture.\"\n\n\"I would never have even known this place was here. It's hidden from the main streets.\"\n\n\"I think that adds to its charm. It feels secluded.\"\n\nMax the waiter came tromping up the steps to take our order and I had to laugh at his expression when he saw Andy. He leaned in and whispered something into Andy's ear and Andy grinned. \"Don't worry, I'll make it up to you. This is Megan,\" he said, gesturing to me.\n\n\"Hello, Megan. Don't let this guy give you a hard time. I get off at 8 if you need a ride home.\" He winked at me and I giggled at the flirting attempt, mostly because of the expression on Andy's face.\n\n\"I don't think that will be necessary,\" Andy said through gritted teeth. I laughed even harder. \"And your tip is getting smaller, even as we speak.\" Max took our order and excused himself making a loud show of clomping down the stairs.\n\nThe food was heavenly and there was so much of it. I ate until I could eat no more, declining dessert. Andy seemed in no hurry to leave, so we talked and finished our sodas. I even picked at the food on my plate a little despite being full \u2013 it was just too good.\n\nI was expecting the night to end when we left the restaurant but Andy drove towards the Canyon. It was such a beautiful night and I was enjoying our conversation. The canyon was dark but I could occasionally see the outline of the rocks and trees. \"Okay, I give up. Where are we going?\"\n\n\"I know a great place for dessert in Heber.\"\n\n\"Ice cream?\"\n\n\"Yep, I figure dinner should be settled by the time we get there.\"\n\n\"You're crazy, but I'm up for the adventure. Let's go.\"\n\nHe reached across and patted my knee. \"I knew you would be. That is one of the great things about you, Megan. You are always up for an adventure.\"\n\n\"Within reason,\" I teased. \"I don't think getting ice cream in Yellowstone would be a good idea tonight.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! You guessed my surprise for next week. Can we go out again next week?\"\n\nI thought about that for a minute. I really liked Andy. He was so much fun. \"Rebekah will be here next weekend. I'm not sure what we will be doing but you can come with us.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" he sounded disappointed, \"I have plans to avoid Rebekah while she is here remember?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's right. Well, it's your loss. We will be having a great time.\"\n\n\"Thanks for rubbing that in.\"\n\n* * *\n\nI woke up the next morning with a sore throat and a stuffy nose. At least with conference, I wouldn't have to change my plans because I was sick. It would be a good day to stay in my pajamas. I set my computer up for a live stream and climbed back in bed just as my phone was ringing.\n\n\"Come over and watch conference with us. We've got snacks.\" Nathan said.\n\n\"Thanks, but I'm sick.\" I sneezed for emphasis.\n\n\"Bummer. I was looking forward to some entertainment.\"\n\n\"You don't need entertainment. Conference is on,\" I reminded him.\n\n\"Well yeah, but it never hurts,\" he admitted. \"See you later. Maybe you'll be better tomorrow.\"\n\nI hung up my phone and closed my eyes trying not to focus on the pressure in my head. A moment later, my phone rang again. I moaned and answered it.\n\n\"You're sick? Can I do anything?\" It was Andy.\n\n\"No, I'm just going to rest thanks.\"\n\n\"Feel better. If you need anything don't hesitate to call me. I will be home all day except during priesthood session.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nI considered turning my phone all the way off but there was no reason anyone else would call. The rest of the day was sort of a blur. I woke to the sound of the organ music coming from my computer. Conference was starting. I sat up pulling my knees to my chest in an attempt to stay awake. My face felt heavy and so did my eyelids.\n\nOnce the talks began, I was able to concentrate if I focused on the screen really hard. There was a beautiful talk about prayer and I enjoyed the combined choir from the SLC area. I did make it through the entire two hours without falling asleep but not much after that.\n\nMy nose was running so much that the box of tissues by my bed was getting plenty of use. My face and head hurt making it hard to sleep but I kept trying.\n\nI could hear occasional sounds as I tossed and turned. Jackie must have come in our room at least once because I heard her rummage through her closet. I think I heard the doorbell or maybe it was someone's phone.\n\nIt was starting to get darker in my room when I woke up. My clock said it was after four. I moaned trying to clear my throat. I couldn't believe I had slept through the afternoon session. It was way past time to get out of bed today. I needed to at least drink something or have some food, though nothing sounded good. I pulled on some sweats and a t-shirt and grabbed my wild hair back into a ponytail with a scrunchie.\n\nI felt so weak and tired as I dragged myself down the hallway. It was very disorienting to wake up with the late afternoon light coming through the windows. Kristen was in the kitchen cooking. I think my zombie like appearance startled her because she jumped just a little as I entered.\n\n\"Megan, are you feeling any better? We didn't even know you were sick but then Andy came by and you were asleep.\"\n\n\"Andy came by?\"\n\nShe smiled and gestured toward the fridge. \"He brought you some chicken soup. It looks homemade.\"\n\n\"I'm not surprised, Andy's a great cook.\" I uncovered the pot and attempted a sniff. My sense of smell was gone and the soup didn't look too appetizing all cold and congealed.\n\n\"Do you want me to heat it up for you?\"\n\n\"No thanks. I think I can do it.\" I took the small pot and placed it onto the stove. The microwave would be faster but it was already in the pot. I still didn't feel like eating but he had gone to so much trouble. When the steam started rising I took a tentative bite. I couldn't vouch for the taste but the warm broth felt good on my throat and the steam opened my sinuses a bit. I ate two bowls of it before going back to bed.\n\nThe next morning I decided to clear my head with a hot shower before conference. Today, I would dress and sit in the living room with everyone else around Kristen's laptop. Then at least if I fell asleep someone would wake me up.\n\nThe shower did wonders for my symptoms. I could smell that someone had just popped popcorn. I padded down the hall in my fuzzy slippers and my favorite comfortable sweats.\n\nThe living room was full of roommates and friends. Tony was sitting by Kristen and Jackie had invited over the girls from next door. Melissa must be the one popping popcorn. I was looking for a place to sit when there was a knock at the door. It was Andy.\n\n\"I was hoping you might be feeling well enough to have some company today.\"\n\n\"I do feel a little better. Thanks for the soup.\"\n\nHe smiled. \"Can I come in and watch with you?\" I opened the door wider and gestured for him to enter. He looked at the crowd gathered around the laptop and seemed to change his plans. \"Do you think we could bundle you up and take you over to my place? You could rest and there's more room.\"\n\nI sighed but nodded. \"Give me a minute.\" I walked down the hall and got my comforter. I wrapped it around myself and over my wet hair. Then we walked over to his apartment. Mark and Nathan were the only ones in the living room preparing for the start of the session. Andy took one look around the place and kicked them off the couch. \"I can take the floor,\" I insisted.\n\n\"Not hardly,\" Mark said, moving to the floor. Both he and Andy gave Nathan a look. Nathan brushed the couch cushion for me as he stood and saluted.\n\n\"Mark's right, you get the couch,\" Andy seconded. He frowned when I sat up and offered the rest to him. He was hesitating when John walked in the door with Emily and Andy had no choice but to sit beside me leaving the rest of the couch for someone else.\n\n\"Wow, Megan, you look terrible,\" Emily said.\n\n\"She's sick,\" Mark, Nathan and Andy all said together.\n\n\"I've looked worse, I'm sure,\" I said, smiling. John and Emily, who were holding hands, sat on the floor. Nathan stood and walked over to the couch, making me move down a space so that he couldn't see them. Andy started to protest and I shook my head. He sighed but didn't say anything. With everyone in place, conference began.\n\nMark handed me a glass of water and during the talks would raise an eyebrow at me if I hadn't taken a drink in a while. He refilled it twice before the session ended. I made it through the session but all that water made it necessary to run home and use the bathroom.\n\nWhile I was home in my apartment, I considered taking a nap but I knew the guys would wonder where I was. Instead, I printed a short baby name list I had found on the internet and headed back.\n\nWe spent the time between sessions throwing around names for Andy's doodle. Some of the names had such crazy meanings. I was surprised. We ate leftover chicken soup and again it hit the spot. It felt good having friends with me and I was having fun despite the aching sinuses.\n\nBy the time, conference began again my throat and head were hurting from laughing so much. We'd narrowed the name choice down to three: Spike, Bronson, and Petri. I was partial to Petri, because of its foreign feel. Andy said it sounded sissy. He seemed to like Spike but I thought that was too tough. Bronson was a sort of compromise. How did anyone ever agree on names for their children? I wondered how many people out there were walking around with a tie breaker name.\n\nAs soon as the closing prayer was said, I made my excuses. It wasn't that hard, I barely had a voice. Andy insisted on escorting me back. Though there wasn't much he could do, the gentle pressure of his hand on my back was comforting. He gave me a quick hug and sent me in out of the wind.\n\n* * *\n\nMonday morning I chose to attend classes. I was still stuffy and weak enough that I called into work. I wasn't sure I should be handling other people's food. I took another long nap in the late afternoon, skipping dinner and family home evening. I apologized to Jackie who was our FHE mom. She seemed disappointed that I wouldn't be there but I promised to help with next week's activity if she needed me.\n\nI kept my routine very simple: classes, sleep, and repeat. Wednesday I was able to add work back into my schedule. All that rest was paying off and I was feeling better every day. By Thursday, I was all ready for Rebekah's visit.\n\nAfter my class, I called Mark. I wasn't sure what time we were leaving for Salt Lake. Andy answered, \"Megan, how are you feeling? I've been wanted to see you all week but I wanted you to rest too.\"\n\n\"I'm better, thanks. It must have been all the well wishes and the chicken soup. What are you doing with Mark's phone?\"\n\n\"He's sleeping. I told him I would get your call.\"\n\n\"He's sleeping? Aren't we supposed to be going soon?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's about time for him to wake up. I think he wants to leave at three.\"\n\n\"He isn't sick is he?\" It would be terrible if I'd made him sick for his sister's visit.\n\n\"No, he just worked a graveyard shift last night so that he would have the day off to get Rebekah. Wait, I'll wake him up.\"\n\n\"Actually, I'll just come by in about half an hour. I haven't had lunch yet.\"\n\n\"That's good. He'll need to get ready.\"\n\nI hung up and made a quick sandwich. I was still a little stuffy so I jumped in the steamy shower for a few minutes. I was done and dressed by 2:45, so I walked over to see if Mark was ready yet.\n\nMark was up, but he looked really sleepy. When his hair was wet it seemed more curly. His shower hadn't woken him up enough. \"Oh you're here, good. Megan, do you think you can drive?\"\n\n\"I think I should.\" I said looking at his puffy eyes. \"Oh, but I can't drive a stick.\"\n\n\"No problem,\" Andy spoke up. He walked to the counter and tossed me his keys. \"Take my car. I just filled it up.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\" Mark said, giving his friend a very weak and sleepy punch in the arm.\n\nI motioned toward the door and then waved goodbye to Andy. He returned my wave and added a \"Drive safe.\" There was also a big flirty smile that I added to my total.\n\n\"We will.\"\n\nWe walked to Andy's car that was just a few spaces away. \"Wait here.\" Mark said and he ran down to his truck that was at the end of the lot. I played with the seat adjustment while I waited.\n\nHe returned a few minutes later with his arms full. \"What's all that?\"\n\n\"Map to Dad's hotel, Rebekah's favorite candy bar in case she is hungry on the way back, a bottle of water, and some tissues.\" He handed the last two items to me. \"You've been sick, hydrate.\"\n\nI smiled, opened the bottle dutifully, and took a drink. \"You think of everything.\"\n\n\"Yeah, except for how tired I would be. Thanks for driving.\"\n\n\"I can read road signs and maps, you should sleep.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Absolutely, I'll just turn the radio on softly. If that won't bother you?\"\n\n\"Nope.\" He leaned the seat back a bit and closed his eyes. It was kind of fun to drive again, it had been almost two months. We were about to the Interstate when I heard a faint snore. I bit my lip so that I wouldn't laugh out loud. He sounded so much like George. I'm sure with my stuffy nose I had been making all kinds of noise in my sleep lately too. At least he was getting some sleep; it was going to be a busy weekend.\n\nJust as we were entering the Salt Lake Valley, he woke up. \"We have a while. You can sleep more.\"\n\n\"Can't sleep anymore. I'm getting too excited.\" He put the seat back up and his legs started to bounce up and down nervously. He looked at me and said, \"It's silly, I know. My parents keep telling me I need a life outside of the family. That's one reason why they encouraged me to go to school here.\"\n\n\"I think it's nice that you think about your family so much. I used to spend a lot of time with my brother, George.\"\n\n\"Not anymore?\"\n\n\"No, he's engaged now. He didn't even bother to call me to tell he was getting married.\"\n\n\"Oh, too busy, huh?\"\n\n\"Something like that.\"\n\nWe sat a few minutes in silence while I tried to find my way through the maze of freeways. When I was sure I was heading in the right direction, I said, \"I can't believe I'm doing this, but can I tell you something?\" It was something I had been thinking of this week. I surprised myself because it wasn't until this moment that I knew I was going to tell and whom I would tell. It just seemed right to have someone know my secret and I knew Mark would get it.\n\n\"Sure, you can tell me.\" Then he hesitated, \"It isn't about Andy is it?\"\n\nI smiled. \"Nope.\"\n\nHe sat up straighter. \"Shoot.\"\n\n\"Remember when you asked me if there was something wrong a couple of weeks ago?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well it was time for my annual cancer follow up and I really hate those appointments.\"\n\nMark sat stunned for a moment. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"I was diagnosed when I was 16. It was kind of a big deal, but it's over and I wish I could just forget it, you know?\"\n\n\"But you have to be checked every year and it just brings everything up again.\" He nodded as if he understood and I did feel better. \"Did the check go well?\"\n\n\"Yes, mostly. There was a little scare, but the tests came back clean.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you say anything? We could have helped you through it.\"\n\n\"I didn't want anyone to get down because of me. I make my mom worried enough. Besides the less people who know the easier it is to forget it.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you told me, but why did you, if you feel that way about it?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure, I guess I just needed one friend who I could talk about it with. My friend Spencer is normally the one I talk to about this stuff, but he's on his mission now. Anyway, enough of that, I think the hotel is on this street. Help me watch for the address.\"\n\nMark grabbed the paper from the space between us, allowing me to change the subject without comment. \"Yeah, it looks like the next block is it. Wait, I see it. Pull in up there.\" He pointed to the small two story hotel on the left just a half a block away. I changed lanes and drove into the parking lot. The traffic had been hectic but I was used to traffic. Even though I had just confessed my secret, I didn't feel weird, just less lonely. Mark's enthusiasm was showing again as we made our way through the parking lot.\n\n\"Where should I park?\"\n\n\"Drive around and I will look for my dad's car. There, see the white land barge; that's it.\" I laughed at the description.\n\n\"Don't laugh. Trust me, my dad needs the space. When I was little I used to try to climb him, pretending to be Spiderman.\"\n\n\"Big?\"\n\n\"Building big, but soft as a teddy bear.\"\n\n\"He sounds nice.\" I pulled into a space just two cars down from the barge.\n\n\"We need their room number, but I want to surprise them.\"\n\n\"Maybe we can get it from the front desk?\"\n\n\"I will, but before I go...\" He reached across and grabbed my hand. \"...thanks for trusting me.\" He squeezed it and then let it go. I sat stunned for a minute, then undid my seatbelt so that I could go with him. \"You don't have to come. I won't be long.\"\n\n\"I don't mind, then we can go straight to the room, unless you wanted to see them alone?\"\n\n\"No. I want you to meet them. Everyone should get a chance to be hugged by my dad. Come on.\"\nChapter 6\n\nThe inner hallway of the hotel was lined with dark blue doors, each with a golden number. We assumed 211 was on the second floor so we headed for the stairs. Mark took them two at a time, partly because of excitement and partly because his legs were just so long. He reached the door before I had caught up and he didn't wait before he knocked. It was like watching a big kid at Christmas.\n\nThe door flew open and a whirl of long, black hair jumped through the opening. Mark expertly caught his sister's hug and returned it, spinning her in the air. She reached up to play with the curls on his head; he needed a cut.\n\n\"Why haven't you cut your hair? You look silly. How are you supposed to find a girlfriend that way?\"\n\n\"Leave your brother alone,\" I heard a soft, deep voice say. \"Good to see you son. Come in for a minute then we can go to dinner.\" Rebekah flitted back inside and I walked slowly up to the scene I had been observing from about ten feet away; mostly because Mark reached his hand out to me. I considered wrapping my arm around his and acting like the girlfriend Rebekah was so sure he couldn't get, but decided it would make Mark too uncomfortable.\n\n\"Rebekah, Dad, this is Megan,\" Mark said as we stepped inside the pastel room. Seeing Brother Cole for the first time was a shock even after Mark's description. He really was a building; well over six feet with solid, wide shoulders. Standing next to Mark had always made me feel short but even Mark was short next to his dad. \"She's the friend Rebekah will be staying with,\" Mark finished his introduction.\n\n\"Megan, I'm so happy to meet you!\" Rebekah closed the gap between us with an energetic movement and hugged me. The hug was only a little gentler than the one Mark had received and I stumbled backwards a step. Mark put his arm out and held it to my back so that I wouldn't fall. \"Sorry,\" she said pulling away and settling under the arm of her brother.\n\n\"Mark has told us a lot about you, Megan. I'm glad to meet you.\" Brother Cole stepped forward and gave me a gentle but firm hug. Now that explained Mark. He came from a family of huggers.\n\nIt was a nice moment of family when mine was far away. It had been almost two months since I had gotten a hug from my dad. When the formalities were over it was time for Mark's hug. I laughed as I watched his dad squeeze him tight and spin, just as Mark had spun Rebekah. It was a funny sight. Mark was a big guy, at least I had always thought so. The hug was completed with another appraisal of Mark's mop. \"You really do need a haircut son.\"\n\nMark barked a laugh and tried to straighten the curls out again. \"I'm enjoying a little length after all those mission haircuts. Give me a break.\" Mark stepped back protecting himself from another hug by wrapping one arm around Rebekah and one around me. \"Where are we going to dinner?\"\n\n\"It's Rebekah's choice. Where to, Button?\"\n\nRebekah rolled her eyes at the nickname and then seemed to consider her options. \"I want shrimp.\"\n\n\"I know just the place, and I can get steak too.\" Brother Cole smiled at the possibilities. \"And French fries, but don't you tell your mom,\" he added conspiratorially. We all laughed as Brother Cole looked guilty.\n\n\"Rebekah, take Megan down to the car. We'll be right there,\" Mark said smiling reassuringly at me as Rebekah grabbed my hand and bounced out the door and down the hall.\n\n\"This is going to be so fun. What are we going to do? Do I get to go to classes with you? Are there any cute guys in your ward? Isn't Elder Spaulding one of Mark's roommates?\"\n\nWe got out to the parking lot so fast, thanks to her skip-like walk, as her enthusiasm grew. Already, I felt old around her. Where did all that energy come from? Had I ever been this way?\n\n\"We have some things planned, but I wanted you to pick some things too. Tomorrow you are going to go to classes with me because Mark's classes aren't open for visitors. Yes, there are many cute guys and Elder Spaulding, we call him Andy now, is one of them. All of Mark's roommates are handsome.\"\n\nWe sat on the hood of the car for several minutes waiting for the men. I wondered what they were doing. We started a game of I-spy to pass the time and Rebekah finally guessed the green gas station sign across the street.\n\n\"Shotgun!\" Rebekah hollered when she saw Mark walking towards the car.\n\n\"Well, that just never gets old,\" Brother Cole said shaking his head as he opened his door. \"No cuddling back there, son,\" he added as Mark and I climbed in the back seat. I had to slide in because there was a suit hanging over the other door.\n\nI felt a blush of embarrassment, but I was sure it was nowhere near as red as Mark was. \"Thanks, Dad. I'll keep that in mind.\" I was once again tempted to snuggle in close and pretend, but I resisted the urge. Mark looked at me with an apologetic smile that I couldn't count. I tried a joke to ease his discomfort.\n\n\"How do you know there's an elephant in your refrigerator?\" I paused as eyes focused on me, \"You can't close the door.\" Groans came from all the Coles as we started off for the restaurant. I smiled because Mark was no longer embarrassed. Silly jokes had always worked to put my friends at ease, especially when I was in the hospital.\n\nIt wasn't far to the restaurant. The Coles managed to give a rundown on everyone in the family before we parked. Brother Cole walked around to open Rebekah's door and I could see where Mark had learned to be such a gentleman. I started to slide towards Mark expecting him to get out. I was right up next to him before I realized that he wasn't moving. I looked at him puzzled. \"I just wanted to apologize for keeping you waiting.\" His eyes were blinking as if he were trying to adjust his vision with me so close.\n\n\"No, problem. Rebekah and I were just getting to know each other. Is everything okay?\"\n\n\"I was just being nosy.\" He continued when he saw my questioning look. \"I made Dad check his blood sugar.\" I smiled broadly trying not to laugh. \"What?\" he protested, placing a hand on my arm and shaking me gently.\n\n\"Nothing, I was just thinking that I wouldn't expect any different from you.\"\n\n\"Great, so now I have a reputation as a busy body.\"\n\n\"But a loveable one,\" I teased putting the tip of my finger on his nose.\n\n\"At least you didn't knock my curls.\" At the reminder, I couldn't resist reaching up and messing the curly top. The curls were springy but soft. Mark sighed exasperated and I smirked at him. In this playful moment, I forgot about the audience just outside the car; Brother Cole rapped lightly on the window startling me into a jump. Mark laughed and tried to fix the damage I had done to his hair. \"Let's go eat before we give them anymore to tease us about.\"\n\n\"Tease you about. I won't even see your dad after tonight.\" I leaned my head to the side. \"Hey, I could give him all kinds of reasons to tease you and I would be safe.\" I moved forward before he could open the door and pecked him on the cheek. I heard a squeal from Rebekah.\n\nMark was sitting stunned, his hand absently probing his cheek. \"Sorry, I couldn't resist. But she should know that you could easily have a girlfriend.\" He continued unmoving and I got a little worried. \"Did I offend you? I'm really sorry, sometimes I just get silly.\"\n\nMark shook his head as if he were trying to wake up. He grabbed my hand as he opened the door and pulled me up. \"It's okay,\" he smiled, \"I was just thinking of Andy. Let's go eat.\"\n\nBrother Cole was clearing his throat as Mark closed the car door. Rebekah ran over to me and wrapped her arm around mine. \"Let's eat. I'm so hungry.\" Then to me in a lower voice, \"We so need to talk.\" I was whisked away wondering what I was going to say now. I felt like I had just put my foot in my mouth and I hadn't even said anything. I should listen less to my spontaneous side.\n\nI tried to steer the conversation in a safe direction while we were waiting for our meal. \"Well, I can sure see where Mark gets his height.\"\n\nRebekah looked puzzled at Mark and then to me again. \"Didn't Mark tell you we were adopted?\"\n\nI eyed Rebekah more closely considering her dark features. She certainly didn't look anything like Mark or her dad. \"No, I guess it never came up.\"\n\nMark spoke up, \"It's true. I don't get my height from my dad, just his tendency to give big hugs.\" It was Mark's turn to grin at me.\n\n\"I just wish I was responsible for his organizational skills, but his mom gets all the credit there.\" Brother Cole added.\n\nDuring dinner, I had the enjoyable experience of listening to the Coles update Mark on what was going on at home. He asked about each family member in detail wondering about school and scouts. They didn't seem to find his questions odd and provided the information easily. It seemed there were two brothers who were 12, Caleb and Micah. I gathered that Caleb had just been ordained a deacon this summer but Micah had not. I wondered about that but was afraid to ask, so I listened more.\n\nAfter dinner, we made our way back to the hotel without me making things awkward. I was grateful that Mark seemed to be too wrapped up in his family to be mad at me for my childishness earlier. I suspected he wouldn't hold a grudge, he just wasn't the type.\n\nWe got back to the hotel and Rebekah ran up to grab her bag. \"Don't let her run too wild.\" Brother Cole cautioned.\n\n\"She'll be too busy for that. Megan has the schedule packed.\" Mark said opening the trunk of Andy's car.\n\nWe said our goodbyes. As we were driving away, Mark said, \"Anywhere you want to stop tonight, girls?\"\n\nRebekah's face lit up. \"Could you introduce me to your roommates and can we see the temple?\"\n\nMark reached across and messed Rebekah's hair this time. \"Already planning on it. How about you, Megan,\" he called to the backseat.\n\n\"I'm good, I should probably turn in early; work tomorrow.\" I smiled at the eyes that shined in the rear view mirror at me. I couldn't see the smile but I was sure it was there. \"Besides you two have a lot of catching up to do. Just let me show Rebekah the apartment first in case you are out late.\"\n\nWe rode in silence for several minutes and then Mark turned the radio on. I couldn't resist singing along and missing George as I did. Ever since George had gotten his license, he and I had sung to the radio as loudly and often as dreadfully as we could. Now I listened as Mark picked up a harmony and Rebekah joined me on the melody. It was just like riding with George except they actually sounded good. We giggled and tapped the beat out on the seats and steering wheel as we rode down the dark highway.\n\nWe could see the Provo temple before we even reached town as it shined against the dark mountain. We drove up around it and I enjoyed the site as much as Rebekah who was seeing it for the first time. Mark turned the radio off and we sat parked for a minute just looking. Mark grabbed Rebekah's hand. \"It won't be long and you will get to go inside.\"\n\n\"Inside again, you mean.\"\n\n\"You've been here before?\"\n\n\"This is the temple where I got sealed to Mom and Dad. Christian and Mark were sealed in this temple too.\"\n\n\"Wow, it must be really neat to see it again.\"\n\n\"It isn't as big as I remember.\"\n\n\"That's because you're a lot bigger now. You were only three the last time.\"\n\n\"I bet you were so cute in your little white dress. Did you guys take pictures?\"\n\n\"Sure, Mom has a whole wall of pictures at home. One family picture for each sealing.\"\n\n\"How many have there been?\"\n\n\"Well there was Mark. Christian and I would make two. Then there was Caleb... three. Micah and Anna make four.\"\n\nI counted in my head and thought about the names I'd heard tonight. \"What about Ruth?\"\n\n\"Oh, she wasn't adopted.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"She's our little miracle.\" Mark added with a fond smile.\n\n\"You're just saying that because you don't have to live with her. She's been so whiny lately.\" This made Mark laugh and he messed Rebekah's hair again. I was relieved because Rebekah's comment made me feel better about my own family. Up 'til now I was wondering how the Coles managed to be so perfect.\n\nWe sat for a few moments in silence just enjoying the Spirit of the temple grounds.\n\nMark shook his head back and forth and stretched his arms. He didn't stretch far before running up against the confines of the car. After a big yawn he said, \"I should probably get you girls home. Megan especially.\"\n\n\"I'm fine. Take your time.\" I was feeling tired but my mind was wide awake and full of questions. Mark's family seemed so interesting. I didn't want to be rude with too many questions and they did have the next couple of days.\n\nAfter a more subdued drive to the apartments, I gave Rebekah the rundown of where everything was and introduced her to Kristen, Jackie, and Melissa. Then she left with Mark and I got ready for bed. It was still early enough and my brain wasn't ready to shut down for the night so I pulled my books out to do a little studying.\n\nI had a hard time concentrating because I kept thinking about our guest. It wasn't long before I regretted not going with her to see Andy's reaction to meeting Rebekah. It would be fun to watch him squirm.\n\nWhen she got back, it was late. I had decided to wait up for her just to be a good hostess. I tried not to let her see how tired I was as she talked past midnight. I was forming a habit, it had been less than two weeks since I stayed up late to talk with friends. I wasn't much for talking about the normal girl stuff like boys and clothes, so Jackie and Rebekah did most of the talking. I did enjoy hearing Rebekah's take on her brother's roommates. Too bad there was a kind of implied confidentiality in these girl's talks. I finally left Rebekah in Jackie's hands and rolled over to sleep. My alarm was going to seem even earlier than usual when it went off in four hours. I was almost out when I heard a squeal of delight. \"She really kissed him?\" Somehow, through my sleepy state I managed to feel the terror of this information in Jackie's hands.\n\n* * *\n\nThe next morning Rebekah stayed with Jackie while I went to work. I was a little jealous as I left them both sleeping. I'd gotten a little less than four hours of sleep but it was worth it if she was having fun.\n\nRebekah joined me later and went with me to some of my classes. I enjoyed watching Rebekah's eyes pop open when she entered the auditorium for my history class. Between classes, her head swiveled around trying to take in all the sights. I was tempted to grab her by the hand and lead her to where we were going. I remembered my first time on campus and could appreciate some of what she was going through but she was probably a lot less used to crowds than I was.\n\nAfter classes, we met Mark and he treated us to a late lunch. After that, we went to the bookstore. Rebekah looked for little souvenirs for everyone in the family. Mark's smile broadened and his eyes danced as he helped her choose. Between the two of them, each person was assured a thoughtful gift. It was so much fun being with them. I knew the Mark's big smiles were not for me and I couldn't count them but it didn't reduce my enjoyment of them.\n\nThough Mark was focused on the gift choosing, he couldn't help but notice the way Rebekah's eyes followed every guy that passed us. I laughed to myself remembering the way she had gushed last night about how good looking all of Mark's roommates were. I would not be sharing that conversation with Mark. I also was never going to tell Andy that she had said he was cuter in his mission pictures because his hair was thinner now.\n\nRebekah bit her lip and made a small, happy noise as we passed an especially handsome guy on our way out. Mark covered his eyes with his hand and I couldn't help a giggle. I was proud of him for controlling that overprotective side even though it was difficult. Trying to recover the situation, I said, \"Well we had better get going if we are going to find a good spot in the canyon for dinner.\"\n\nMark sighed in relief and we headed back to the apartments to gather supplies and people. The idea of isolating his sister in the mountains away from all the dangers of campus must have appealed a lot to Mark.\n\nThe group that would be going with us was not as large as I was hoping for, but perhaps it didn't matter. We really didn't need big numbers to have fun. Jackie and Melissa would be coming with us but Kristen had plans already. Among the guys, I was only sure about Mark.\n\nI managed to talk Andy into coming with us by promising that I would be his date. This way he wouldn't seem unattached around Rebekah, not that she would care. It was funny that he was so afraid of her. Together Mark and Andy talked Nathan into missing the game and coming with us.\n\nThe drive up the canyon was beautiful. Mark, Rebekah and Jackie were in his truck while the rest of us went in Andy's car. Our group was lively but I was a bit quiet. It was a combination of being tired and wondering what interesting conversations were going on between the Coles.\n\nThe fire was roaring in no time; there must have been some former scouts among us. As we all sat around talking and laughing, it brought back memories of camping with my family. Everyone found a stick and tried to cook a hotdog on the fire; some were more successful than others were. I put my hand on Mark's shoulder to keep him quiet when Nathan offered to help Rebekah who was struggling with hers. Very happy to receive the help, she smiled broadly up at him; yet another smile I enjoyed but couldn't count. I was pretty sure that Rebekah could have figured out how to cook the hotdog herself. She was really much better at this flirting thing than I was.\n\nMark started to clear his throat and I tightened my fingers on his shoulder. If he wasn't careful, his overprotectiveness was really going to embarrass Rebekah. Andy elbowed me, his eyebrows raised and I gave him a look that said, \"Can't you control your friend?\" He grinned and left his place beside me to sit on the other side of Mark.\n\nMelissa scooted over into the space next to me that Andy had just left. Nathan sat across the fire from us with Jackie on one side and Rebekah on the other. He didn't look like he was missing that game much.\n\nThe sun started to set and we quickly cleaned up dinner before we were out of light. Mark anchored the trash bag in the back of his truck with a log from the bundle of firewood he'd brought. I wouldn't even have thought of bring firewood. Sometimes, I thought his attention to detail was well suited for a career in recreation.\n\nThe seating arrangements when we sat back down were almost the same except for this time Mark was sitting next to his sister. She barely seemed to notice because all of her focus was on Nathan to her right. I had Andy sit beside Mark again so that he could provide some kind of calming influence.\n\nDarkness, lit only by campfire has a way of bringing out the showmanship in some people. You never really need to plan for entertainment around a fire because it just seems to happen spontaneously. Nathan started us off with his Donald Duck voice. Somehow, it sounded funnier in the dark. The girls on either side of Nathan giggled and their eyes danced in the firelight. Encouraged, he moved on to his impression of a gorilla trying to catch a balloon. He was leaping around the circle with his arms hanging. Mark seemed torn between amusement and caution as his eyes moved back and forth from Nathan to Rebekah.\n\nAndy was next up on the program, suggesting that we all sing some hymns. It warmed my heart to sit there in the circle and sing with my friends. He reached over and held my hand and I squeezed it.\n\nAfter several hymns, we moved on the inevitable. Melissa began a ghost story. She made it only two sentences before it started.\n\n\"Is this the one where the ghost is looking for its head?\"\n\n\"I've heard this one before. Isn't it buried somewhere in the woods?\"\n\n\"No, that's another story, in this one the ghost is looking for its dog.\"\n\n\"Oh, I've heard that one.\"\n\n\"Me too.\"\n\nBy now, the mood was broken and there was really no point in continuing the story. I was secretly glad; I didn't care much for scary stories, especially in the woods at night.\n\nWe let the fire die down as we talked. Rebekah occasionally turned to have her brother whisper something in her ear that made her grin. How wonderful that the two of them could be together and that Mark could relax enough to enjoy it.\n\nMelissa was riding with Mark and Rebekah this time. I wondered if she might be looking for some more time with Mark. Would Rebekah notice someone crushing on her brother? I figured the answer was not today. She seemed in her own little world. Then I wondered if I should find some discreet time to talk to Melissa about the kiss with Mark. The idea of having to explain that one didn't thrill me much.\n\nI brightened as we drove because it soon became apparent that such a discussion might not be necessary. Jackie was in full flirt mode with Nathan in the back seat. This was probably the real cause of the seating changes. I couldn't blame her. Nathan had definitely shined tonight. Rebekah would have probably kicked me out of the car so that she could ride with Nathan too but being on a date with Andy had made that impossible. Besides, I doubted that Mark would stand for it.\n\n* * *\n\nIt was late when we got back, but Rebekah was still really excited. We said quick good nights to the guys and went back to our apartment for some ice cream and late night girl talk again. Tonight's conversation seemed to be all about Nathan. Both Jackie and Rebekah were gushing about how cute he was. I smiled thinking of the other Nathan I knew, the one who watched ESPN nonstop and couldn't lose with grace.\n\nI was yawning well before the others showed any signs of being tired. I didn't really have anything to contribute to the conversation anyway. Even without much participation from me, we were up past 2 am. We went to bed and as soon as my head hit the pillow, I was out.\n\nSaturday morning was Rebekah's choice of activities. She really wanted to spend some more time with Mark's roommates, mostly Nathan. We made pancake batter, grabbed some board games and dishes, and then marched over to D41. It was just the two of us this morning. Jackie was sleeping in. Sleeping in sounded wonderful to me too, but Rebekah was only here a short time. The cold shower I took to wake me up worked but I could tell that I wasn't as peppy as usual.\n\nMark welcomed us in with a big smile. I figured I could count that one because I had brought his sister over for him. Okay, so it was a stretch but the week was almost over and I was padding my total.\n\nHe was pleased that we would be staying in for the morning. He looked a little tired, too, but I suspect the real reason was that he wouldn't have to protect Rebekah from a city of guys. Fortunately, from Mark's point of view, Nathan was leaving early for work. Rebekah was a bit disappointed by the news, but managed not to appear too down in front of Mark. She soon rallied and we started to make the pancakes.\n\nIt was a good thing that we had lots of batter because everyone was hungry. It had been too long since I'd eaten breakfast with my brothers. It was just like Saturday morning at home. Though I loved the atmosphere, I didn't feel at all like digging in. I picked at my food, trying to decide if I felt like eating.\n\nI had to shake it off; I was supposed to be leading this party. I jumped up and took my plate to the sink, disposing of the half eaten pancake as I went. Then I cleared the coffee table so that we could set up the first board game.\n\n\"Andy, we need music. Got any?\" I commanded rather than asked.\n\n\"Yep,\" he shoved in his last bite of pancake (the bite was big enough to be three bites) and jogged down the hall.\n\nIn no time, we were laughing and playing. Rebekah was really enjoying herself and Mark glowed with joy as he watched her. The music Andy provided was a bit odd. He informed us it was his dance practice CD from a social dance class he'd had last semester. This gave the guys an idea. Andy and Mark moved the table into the hall so that the floor would be clear for dancing. Andy grabbed my hand and tried to show us some of the swing moves, but I was so tired that I felt more dizzy than anything else. Mark became Rebekah's partner and the two danced as if they had practiced together lots. Was this perhaps, a Cole family tradition, like singing in the car or bear hugs?\n\nLunch was a picnic in the park and my favorite, a surprise. We had been unable to get tickets to any musical performances this weekend but there was a free hand bell choir concert going on at a downtown park. We carried blankets and food to the concert area as they were setting up. This way we got a good seat and we got to watch as they tested their bells. Rebekah was very intent as she watched the care with which they handled them. Each bell ringer wore white gloves. The music that came from the bells was amazing. It was such an enjoyable afternoon that I wasn't ready for it to end.\n\nWith the concert over, it was time for Mark and Rebekah to head to Salt Lake. He was going to take her to Temple Square before they met their dad for dinner. I gave Rebekah a hug and a card with my phone number in it, hoping she would call me if she needed another girl to talk too. Though, I suspected in the Cole house that she had plenty of company.\n\nThe rest of the day I planned to devote to homework, but I was useless. There were still plenty of things like laundry and shopping to take care of so I set the books aside and did my chores. I seemed to be doing this a lot. Amazingly, my grades were okay. I was blessed with easy classes this semester, I guess.\n\nThe next morning when I got up for church I felt dizzy. It took me a minute before I could stand safely. Clearly, I had overdone this week. While I waited for my turn to shower, I tried some breakfast but nothing sounded good. I settled for nibbling on some crackers and had a small glass of juice.\n\nEven after my shower, it was obvious to my roommates that something was wrong. I guessed my wrinkled dress and wet hair pulled back in a scrunchie were good clues. I'd just had too many late nights recently. With a little rest, I would be good as new.\n\n\"You look terrible. Maybe you should stay home.\" Kristen said as she spied the lines around my eyes.\n\n\"I'm fine. I'm just a little tired.\"\n\nAndy seemed not to notice my disarray. He beamed at me with a wide smile as he held my door open. That was smile number one for the week. I could see Mark getting into his truck with a piece of toast in his teeth. I hoped he'd had a good visit with his dad. Andy told me about work as we drove to church. Apparently, the restaurant was packed and all four tables in the balcony were full. He had drawn the short straw and had waited on all of them. I smiled compassionately as he rubbed the back of his legs complaining about the stairs. Maybe Kristen was right; I should have stayed home. I wasn't even being good company.\n\nAs our group made its way into the large lecture room for Sacrament Meeting, Mark placed his long arm across my back and squeezed my shoulders. \"Thank you so much for your help. Rebekah had a wonderful time. She left very happy.\"\n\n\"No problem. I had fun too.\"\n\nHe looked more carefully and grabbed my arm. \"We'll catch up,\" Mark called as he stopped off to the side. Andy looked back, curiosity clear on his face but he kept walking. \"How sick are you Megan?\"\n\n\"I'm not sick, I'm just tired.\"\n\n\"You look awful we shouldn't have pushed you so much especially since you were just getting over something.\" He shook his head. \"Sorry.\"\n\n\"It's no big deal. I'll just take a nap.\"\n\n\"You need to be more careful.\" He reached up feeling my forehead and checking my eyes. \"You need to go home and go to bed. I'll drive you, just let me tell them I'm going.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" I said as forcefully as I could without shouting. \"I want to stay for church. I didn't tell you that stuff so you could baby me.\" I marched angrily past him and into the room with more energy than I'd used all morning. The prelude played quietly and I took my seat. For the first time today, I was feeling something other than tired... I was mad.\n\nAndy smiled at me. I rubbed my eyes. They were so tired they were tearing.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" he whispered.\n\n\"Yes, just tired.\"\n\n\"Oh, well rest your head here.\" He placed his arm around my shoulders and pressed his hand against my face to push it down onto his arm. I had to admit it felt good to rest my head a moment. I heard Mark sit down but I didn't look at him. Why had I told him about the cancer? He was as bad as a mother hen. Spencer was never like that. He used to tell me to get over it so that we could hang out again.\n\nI declined the invitation from Andy to go over for dinner. Instead, I went straight home from church and crawled into bed, mostly because I was tired but also because I didn't want to see Mark. I was still angry.\nChapter 7\n\nIt was Monday morning when I got out of bed again. 5:15 was a little easier this morning, maybe because I had been asleep for 14 hours. I went through my normal routine to get ready, which wasn't that involved. I tried to be out the door by 5:30 so that I would have a good half an hour to get to work. I grabbed my backpack and headed out the door.\n\nMy bike wasn't in the rack. I walked to a rack nearby looking for it but I was sure I had parked it in the usual spot. It couldn't be stolen. I was sure that I'd locked it up.\n\n\"Looking for something?\"\n\nI looked up and scanned the parking lot for the source of the voice. \"My bike,\" I said, feeling wary. Mark was standing beside his truck with his arms folded across his chest. His eyes were sleepy and his hair looked like he had just rolled out of bed.\n\n\"I've got it. Come on.\"\n\nI walked over to him, my arms crossed. I had a sneaking suspicion that I was being mothered again and I didn't like it.\n\n\"I can ride my bike to work. I'm fine. Please give it to me.\" I said it nicely but I was firm. If I wasted much more time I might be late to work.\n\n\"I know you can. I can see you feel better. Look better too. This is all about breakfast.\"\n\n\"Breakfast? I've already eaten.\"\n\n\"No. My breakfast. Crow, I believe, is on the menu. Seriously, please let me apologize. Get in.\"\n\nHe held the door open and I caved. \"Fine but I really need to get to work.\"\n\n\"I am really sorry that I offended you. I get nosy and bossy. It's a big flaw. I just don't like to see the people I care about hurting themselves.\"\n\nI wasn't going to let him off that easy. \"But you took private information and rubbed it in my face. I told you I hated it when people worried about me, but you still...\"\n\n\"Megan, I can't help that I know now. And yes, it is sometimes going to affect how I react. But really it's only because I want you to be healthy.\"\n\nI sighed. It was the same with my mom. I couldn't be mad at someone for caring, even if it was obnoxious. \"You have to trust me to take care of myself. I'm not a baby.\" This was something I wanted him to understand upfront. Maybe we could avoid this in the future.\n\n\"You're right. I'm sorry. Bu....\" He stopped abruptly.\n\n\"Just say it.\"\n\n\"No, I don't think I will.\"\n\n\"Mark, it's okay. I'm not mad at you. I know you were just being a good friend. You'll feel better if you just say it, so go ahead.\"\n\nHe looked at me hesitantly. \"It's just that I think you are more concerned with everyone else than you are with yourself and as long as that is the case I will be watching out for you. I should have been paying better attention this weekend.\"\n\n\"Thank you, that's really sweet, but I don't want you to worry about me all the time. I hate being the cause of that.\"\n\n\"I won't be worrying, just watching. There's a difference... really.\" He looked at my skeptical expression. \"Honest.\"\n\nI put my face in my hands and shook my head. After a moment I sat back up and brushed my hair back into place.\n\n\"Well if it wasn't me you were worrying about, I'm sure it would be someone else.\"\n\n\"Figured that out did ya?\" I smile spread across his face, a genuine 'picture worth a thousand words' kind of smile. I wanted to count it twice. \"Could you try to keep it a secret that I'm a big time meddler, please?\"\n\nI laughed as if he was already forgiven. I seemed like I was letting him off too easy, but I just couldn't help it. He'd melted away any frustration I'd felt.\n\nMark parked the truck and got the bike out of the back for me. While I looked it up, I asked, \"How did you get my bike out of the rack? I was sure I locked it up.\"\n\n\"You did. I know the combination from the night of the concert. I saw you take the chain off so that you could lock it up.\"\n\nI put it in the rack and turned into a hug. If I got too many more of these hugs, I might just become an honorary Cole. His embrace was comforting so I lingered for a moment. I liked not being mad at him much better.\n\n\"Thanks for the ride. When's your first class?\"\n\n\"Ten. I'm not much of a morning person,\" He climbed back into his truck and drove away. Just like I'd suspected, he had gotten out of bed just for me. How could such little things make me feel so special? These guys were spoiling me.\n\nThe ride had given me an extra ten minutes so I checked my phone messages. I had missed a call from my mom last night and a call from Rebekah, if I got the area code right. I would call every one tomorrow. Tonight, I promised myself another date with my bed; I would be heading there after dinner.\n\nThursday night, Andy showed up with flowers. These flowers had a fall theme and were all oranges and yellows. It was a beautiful arrangement and I was flattered.\n\n\"I've missed you this week. How are you feeling?\" he said.\n\n\"I'm great! I just needed to catch up on my sleep. What have I missed?\"\n\n\"Nothing, really. We're sort of boring without you to organize us.\" What an absurdity. It wasn't as if I was having a party all week. Andy just grinned at me and I playfully punched him in the arm. I hadn't gotten many smiles this week since I'd spent so much time in bed. \"Can I take you to dinner?\"\n\n\"That sounds good but I was just about to eat. Want to join me?\" I wanted to kick myself for inviting him. I was a little embarrassed by my cooking. Andy was such a great cook and I was just learning. \"As long as you promise not to laugh or make faces when you taste it.\"\n\n\"I promise,\" he said, crossing his heart with his index finger.\n\nI dished up two helpings of brown rice and vegetable stir fry. I was trying to eat healthier. All the extra rest this week had gone a long way towards improving the way I felt, but some added nutrition couldn't hurt. This seemed like a good source of vitamins even though I'd never really cooked it before.\n\nThe flavor wasn't bad, I noted as I took my first bite. I'd gotten the spices in the stir fry just right. It was the texture that made me grimace.\n\n\"Hey, you said no faces,\" Andy complained while he chewed.\n\n\"I've never cooked brown rice before, but I don't think it is supposed to be this crunchy.\"\n\n\"Brown rice just takes longer than white. No worries, you'll get the hang of it.\" His encouraging words and smile made me feel better even if I couldn't count it. This smile just seemed too much like a pity smile.\n\n\"We could still go out,\" I offered as I choked down the next bite.\n\n\"But you've already cooked.\" He manfully took another bite and chewed and chewed and chewed. The sight of him chewing for longer than should be necessary gave me a fit of the giggles. Big tears formed in my eyes as I tried to get myself under control. They spilled over onto my cheeks. Andy picked up on them right away and couldn't resist, \"Don't cry, Megan. See, I'm eating it.\" He placed another bite into his mouth and the giggles returned in force.\n\n\"What are you doing to Megan?\" Melissa inquired as she exited her room, flute in hand. She took one look at my red face and started to laugh too.\n\n\"I think it's because she thinks I hate her cooking. But I'm almost finished.\" He held his bowl out to show her and then scooped another bite into his mouth. I pushed my bowl away and laid my head on the table still trying to get control of my giggles. Melissa gave up on getting coherent speech from me and went back to practicing.\n\nAndy mercifully was silent for a time and I finally calmed enough to speak. \"Okay, ice cream is on me. You definitely deserve it after that performance.\"\n\n* * *\n\nThe next day was sure to be an interesting one. I had an assignment for one of my recreation classes to spend a day in a wheelchair. This was supposed to teach me about accessibility. By necessity, my day would not begin until I finished work. Friday morning, I walked to work so that I would not have to worry about my bike. After my shift, I picked up the wheelchair at my professor's office.\n\nI signed out the chair, sat down, and proceeded to make my way through to my first class. Luckily, I had a good half an hour to get there \u2013 and it looked like I was going to need it. I found my progress was very slow. I didn't realize how weak my arms were until I tried to wheel the chair up a small ramp. I was unable to go the whole way without resting and when I stopped to rest, the chair would roll backwards. It took several tries before I made it.\n\nThe day was a lot more difficult than I expected. To make things worse, when classes were over I realized I would never be able to get home on my own power. I tried Mark's cell first but he his line was busy. Andy answered my call on the second ring and happily came to pick me up. It took some doing but with the back seat down we were able to get the folded wheelchair into his car. We just had to drive with the hatchback door up.\n\n\"So how was your day?\"\n\n\"Interesting... I had no idea.\"\n\nHe dropped me off as close to my door as he could, hoping this would help me, but then we noticed the ramp was down about a hundred feet from where he had parked. He wrestled the chair from the back and set it up for me. \"Can't you just cheat?\"\n\nI sighed, \"No, the whole point is to see what it is really like.\"\n\n\"Can I at least push you?\"\n\n\"Sure, and thanks for asking. You know some people today just came up behind me and started pushing, without even saying anything to me. It made me feel really out of control.\"\n\n\"They were probably just trying to help.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know, but still I'm a person. I felt like an obstacle.\"\n\n\"Well, there you go. You learned something... now you will never do that.\" He saw me safely through my front door and mussed my hair on his way out. Alone in the kitchen, I tried fixing myself a snack. Everything looked so different now. I had no idea how high the upper cabinets really were or even how wide the kitchen sink was. I barely reached the faucet to wash an apple that I'd found on the counter.\n\nHow was I going to be fix dinner? Andy must have been thinking the same thing because he called a minute later.\n\n\"Hi, I'm coming over to help you with dinner tonight. You have no choice. I will be there in an hour.\"\n\n\"Sure, you just want to laugh at my cooking some more.\"\n\n\"Hey, I never laughed. That was you. Wait a second...\" I held the line while he talked with someone in the background. A minute later he was back on the phone, \"Mark's coming too; so make plenty.\" He laughed at his own joke and I groaned. \"Hey where is that spunky attitude I like so much?\"\n\nHe was right. I was being a lot more pessimistic than usual lately. Once in the early morning hours in my grey and pink walled hospital room, I had given into the loneliness and despair. I cried, curled in on myself, not ignoring the pain or the boredom for once. The results had been a monster headache and pitiful glances from the nursing staff when they brought me my morning meds. From that moment on, I promised never to let myself get so down again. No one had seen me that day, and I wasn't about to let Andy see me like that.\n\nI worked on making my voice sound brighter. \"I can't wait to see you both, remember it's black tie so don't disappoint.\"\n\nMy laugh was only a bit forced as he whistled. \"Yes, Ma'am.\"\n\nAlthough he had been joking, I started to wonder what I would make that would feed the bottomless pits who were coming to dinner. Enchiladas had always been my favorite so I'd made sure that my mom taught me how to make them. At least this time I wouldn't be embarrassed like I was with the rice.\n\nA quick inventory of ingredients had me calling Andy back to see if he could pick up a few things before he came over. It was surprising how much effort was needed just to look in the refrigerator. It felt like I was dancing because of the way I had to change directions in my chair. It was probably a good thing that the guys were coming over or that apple would be all I'd be eating.\n\nMy roommates seemed to be buzzing around in all directions. Not one of them seemed to even notice the wheelchair. I think that the upcoming midterms might have something to do with it. I just tried to stay out of their way.\n\nWith my helpers, dinner was prepared in no time. Andy cooked the meat while Mark chopped the ingredients. They brought them over to the table so that I could assemble the enchiladas. Though they weren't as good as the ones I'd eaten at the restaurant with Andy, at least this time the complements were deserved. They both devoured their portions and went for seconds \"It feels a little like I'm cheating to have had so much help with dinner.\" I complained.\n\nBut Mark pointed out, \"Don't feel bad. You were unprepared for this. If you were in a wheelchair all the time, things wouldn't be stored in cabinets that were too high.\"\n\n\"Plus,\" Andy put in, \"we would have missed out on that yummy dinner.\"\n\n\"This whole day was just harder than I expected. I must have the weakest arms in Utah. I couldn't even make it up the special ramps designed for wheelchairs.\"\n\n\"You're looking at this wrong.\" Mark sat back down after taking his plate to the sink. He was starting to bounce nervously in that way he sometimes did when he was fired up about something. \"Some of your frustrations today could have been solved with the right kind of chair. The chair you're using is made for pushing. A chair designed for you would have good balance and be easier to maneuver.\"\n\nThat made me feel a little better. \"Still you should see how long it takes to get anywhere; even if I had the right chair, I would still have to go out of my way all the time to find elevators and ramps. Even one or two steps is impossible and I had to go the long way around.\"\n\n\"That gets a bit trickier,\" Mark agreed running his fingers in patterns absentmindedly on the table as he spoke. \"Whenever we take Micah anywhere we always try to check for the best route. We make sure we park in the right spot or allow enough time depending on the building. Because you're right, accessible and convenient are not the same thing.\"\n\n\"Micah's in a wheelchair?\"\n\n\"Yeah, guess I never told you. He has cerebral palsy. So believe me, I know about this. If you had to get around campus in a wheelchair all the time, you would plan your class times and locations appropriately.\"\n\n\"How? Everything is still out of the way and you have to go where the classes are, it's not like you can have them come to you.\"\n\n\"No, but if you have a choice between a Religion class on the first floor or the third which would you choose? And instead of zigzagging all over campus you would probably try to group your classes in nearby buildings, then move on to another area.\"\n\nAndy was listening intently and I was taking notes. \"Yeah, and I think they have an office on campus that helps with stuff like that.\"\n\n\"See, it just takes a little prep,\" Mark finished matter-of-factly. \"I can help you with your paper if you want.\"\n\n\"Thanks but I think I am going to talk about another kind of accessibility. I haven't quite worked it out yet, but I guess I would call it an emotional accessibility. The one thing, aside from my aching arms, that I really noticed today was how no one really looked me in the eye. They just kind of looked past me.\"\n\n\"I know all about that too, unfortunately. Very few people acknowledge Micah.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I want to write about this strange distance between people and how recreation can bridge the gap.\"\n\n\"Sounds awesome. I want to read it when you are done.\" Mark said patting my shoulder. \"Hate to eat and run but I have work. Thanks for dinner, Megan.\" Andy stayed long enough to see that I had everything I needed and then he left me to write while the ideas were still fresh.\n\nBrainstorming ran long and I didn't actually write much. I couldn't help but think about Mark and wonder how he handled the reactions people had to Micah. Too bad he was at work and I couldn't call him. I did the best I could, trying to focus on breaking the ice kinds of activities. If people could just learn to look past the surface then my work would be half done.\n\nWhen I stood up from the chair at bedtime, I felt relieved and a little guilty. I thanked Heavenly Father that night for things I had never thought to thank Him for before. Then I laid in bed awake for a while smiling at the success of my enchiladas.\n\n* * *\n\nThe end of the month was fast approaching and I still hadn't talked to my visiting teaching sisters to encourage them or even done my own visiting teaching. I approached Alexis, my companion, about visiting teaching and she was free Sunday so I called and made appointments. Alexis prepared the lesson and I even read it ahead of time so that I could contribute. Still waiting for an answer to my prayer, I was just going through the motions not really seeing the point. At least if my visiting teaching was done, I would feel better about calling the other sisters.\n\n* * *\n\nAndy complained when I spent several nights in planning meetings for some upcoming activities. I tried to convince him that I was not the personal activities director of apartment D41 but he just frowned and said he missed me. It was kind of sweet; I was starting to feel like we were all some sort of family.\n\nSaturday, I helped with some activities for the kids of the family housing on campus. Autumn was definitely here. We were all set up with relay games and face painting in the open field that was at the center of the lower apartment units. The turnout was pretty good, I was in charge of a group of about ten kids and there were two more groups besides mine.\n\nWe were just finishing up a baby pumpkin relay where the kids each ran to the end of field and took a baby pumpkin and then walked back holding it up on their head. With all the kids in the group now holding a pumpkin, we went to the table to decorate them. The kids were fast and it wasn't long before pumpkins were decorated. They began to decorate themselves and each other with the paints and markers.\n\nThe next activity we were supposed to do was occupied by another group, so I needed to come up with a distraction for my group fast. Back home I was the nursery leader and I'd learned that it was best to stay on your toes with lots of activities.\n\nI gathered the kids in a circle for a game of Duck Goose. It was so cute, some of the kids were very small and they had never played before. I grabbed one little boy by the hand taking him around the circle showing him what to do. When goose came he got a little confused and ran through the circle and then back again. A few more turns and we were all giggling and chasing each other in an impromptu game of tag. I'd lost count of smiles so far this morning.\n\nWhen it was time, I herded my group over to the leaf jump area and grabbed the rake to make the pile a little bigger for them. Excitedly, they entered the leaves and began to jump and throw them in the air. It soon became obvious that a bunch of small piles instead of one big one would be safer. This allowed the kids to jump with enthusiasm without bumping into each other. The activity was nearly over and I scanned the activity area for signs that things were breaking up. I was surprised to see Andy sitting near a tree watching the festivities. My hands were full with the kids. I didn't have time to go over and question him or even wave before I was being dragged across the field to where the whole group was gathering.\n\nEach of the kids had a decorated cookie and a bag of popcorn to take with them, so I lined them up and marched them past the table for their treats. They sat in a small group again on the grass waiting for their parents to get them. Activities weren't really necessary with the cookies around, so I flopped on the grass to catch my breath. They ate contentedly and their frosting covered faces seemed both tired and happy. It had been a couple of months since I had worked with little kids in nursery but I was pleased to see that I hadn't forgotten how to play with them. Dad always said it was because I was just a big kid.\n\nSeveral members of my group left with their parents. I was helping one little girl pick up her popcorn that had spilled everywhere. We gave up, I wiped her tears, and sent her to the table to get another bag. I remembered my audience when he spoke.\n\n\"You're really good with them, you know?\"\n\n\"Andy, hi! What are you doing here?\" I asked, happy to see him. Before he could answer, a few more parents came and picked up their kids. I absently exchanged 'thank you's and 'glad you could come's. One little boy with a frosting covered face gave me a hug. I smiled, patted his back, and thanked him for being so good.\n\nThe two kids left had finished their cookies and were getting restless. I sat them beside me again and went into story mode. It would be easier to keep track of them if they were not running in opposite directions. The kids giggled as my leaf bunny jumped from tree to tree looking for his favorite food, sugar cookies. I looked up to where Andy was seated a few feet away. He was also listening to my story. I smiled at him and his return smile was broad and bright. I added it to the running total of the day. The last of the parents stood nearby waiting for the story to be over so that they could take their children home. Quickly, I wrapped it up and sent the goo covered kids on their way.\n\nAndy stood and came over grabbing my hand casually. \"I was hoping that I could take you to lunch,\" he said, answering the question that had been interrupted before.\n\n\"Careful,\" I said glancing at our hands, \"I think I am covered in frosting and paint.\"\n\n\"That's okay, I missed out on the activities. This way, I get to participate.\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't know you wanted to play? I think there are a few more baby pumpkins.\"\n\n\"Lunch?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said leaning on his shoulder, \"unless you just want to eat some leftover popcorn and sugar cookies?\"\n\nHe paused putting his finger to his lips as if deep in thought. \"Tempting.\"\n\n\"I do need to clean up first.\" I called over my shoulder already heading for a table. He followed and we began to box up the supplies.\n\nHe grabbed my hand again and drew a smiley face on the back of it with one of the markers. \"You missed a spot,\" he said as he bent and kissed it.\n\nThis was fun. I had never really thought about the whole boyfriend thing before; but if that is what Andy was becoming, it had its advantages. With things all cleaned up, I said goodbye to the other volunteers making arrangements to meet and evaluate the activity after class on Monday. Andy led me to his car and opened the door for me. I handed him a bag as he got into the car. He opened it, peeked inside, and laughed. \"Great, you got dessert. I get the ghost one with the raisin eyes,\"\n\n\"Suits me,\" I said smiling and looking down at my stained shirt, \"I want the pumpkin anyway; orange is definitely my color.\"\n\n\"Do you want to go home and change first?\" he asked politely following my gaze.\n\n\"I think it will be okay, consider it a badge of honor for the day's activities,\" I said throwing my shoulders back as if in pride. \"Drive on, good sir.\" I couldn't help giggling as he sat up at attention and started the car with an air of an obedient servant.\n\nLunch was at a small Chinese restaurant just off campus. I was glad that my wardrobe hadn't been too out of place for where he was taking me. I excused myself when we walked in and went to clean up in the bathroom; stained was one thing but sticky was beginning to feel a bit uncomfortable. I was scrubbing the paint off of my hands when I saw the smiley face again. I washed lightly over it, hoping that it would stay for a while. I could remember the feeling of his lips on the spot and it made my face feel hot. The little smile stared at me and I wondered if I should count it.\n\nHe stood up from his seat and handed me a chocolate colored bear with a big yellow ribbon when I returned from the bathroom. \"Oh, it's so cute. But why?\"\n\n\"It's sort of an anniversary present. Five weeks ago yesterday was our first date.\" He shrugged as if it wasn't a big deal.\n\nWow, I was really out of it with this dating thing. \"I'm sorry I didn't get you anything.\"\n\n\"That's okay. I'm just glad to be with you. It's been a long week.\"\n\nI smiled as his bottom lip puckered ever so slightly in a frown. I had no idea that being away from me could make anyone sad let alone this talented man. \"Well, thank you for lunch and the bear. It is really thoughtful.\" Then I leaned across the table and hugged him.\n\nFrom then on, time with Andy became a normal part of my day. We were always together when we could be, sometimes with the guys and sometimes alone. Of course, he worked most weekends, so I saved that time for roommate bonding and homework. I was settling down into the whole 'boyfriend relationship thing', wondering what I had been so worried about for so long, when things got tricky.\nChapter 8\n\nOne Saturday evening in early November, I decided to celebrate the completion of a term paper by doing something with the guys. I knocked on their door feeling buoyant after the stress of my homework was lifted.\n\nNathan answered looking put out. \"What's the matter?\" I asked.\n\n\"John and Emily are going out again. That's the third time this week,\" he fumed.\n\nI put my arm around his shoulder and led him back to the couch. \"Hey, why don't we do something fun tonight? Andy's at work, so I'm free.\"\n\n\"What would we do?\"\n\nI thought for a second trying to think of something Nathan would enjoy. \"We could go bowling and then I will treat you to a pizza.\"\n\nHis face brightened. \"You're on! Let me get my jacket.\" It had been a slow week for smiles and a smile from Nathan was always a treat because they tended to be rare.\n\n\"Well, I need my purse and jacket too. Meet you at your car in five?\" He nodded and I went running across the parking lot to my apartment. Bowling with Nathan probably wasn't the best idea; he could get so worked up, but at least it would get his mind off of things. I wonder how George would handle me dating his friends. I winced grateful that the idea hadn't crossed my mind since I was 14.\n\n\"Nathan those shoes are definitely you.\"\n\nHe huffed a laugh, \"I was thinking the same thing. Maybe I should see if they sell 'em.\"\n\n\"Try to get the old ones that don't match.\"\n\n\"I'll see what I can do. Are we going to play or are we going to keep talking about how stunning I am? I mean, I'm open to either one but we did come here to play.\"\n\n\"Alright, just you wait. I have some moves.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but are they good?\"\n\nI managed to have a game with no gutter balls, a personal first, and Nathan reined in his power enough that the ball only jumped into the other lane once. The first two games had us evenly matched; neither of us broke a hundred on our score. I managed to pull ahead the first game and he won the second. \"Shall we go best two out of three?\" I asked as we tallied the final score.\n\n\"No, let's leave things. That way we're both winners. You mentioned pizza right?\"\n\nI stared at Nathan surprised by this response. \"Who are you and what have you done with my friend, Nathan?\"\n\n\"I'm working on some things in preparation for my mission.\" He said shrugging. \"Competition is a tough one for me.\"\n\nWow, Nathan always surprised me. \"You're awesome!\" I told him honestly and have him a quick hug. \"Let's go get that pizza. No peppers, okay?\"\n\n\"I don't do vegetables anyway.\" He smiled at me and I frowned at him in a motherly way. \"Some habits are harder to change than others,\" he said. That made five smiles in all from Nathan in one night. The evening was a success. Nathan was feeling better and I had helped with that. Cheering up a friend had been a good way to celebrate my paper.\n\n* * *\n\nThe next morning on the ride to church, Andy seemed distracted. I thought that maybe he was thinking about the lesson he had to give in Elders' Quorum. \"Is everything okay?\" I asked.\n\nHe grunted and I wasn't sure what that meant. I continued to stare at him looking for some kind of clue. Finally, he said, \"We don't really have time to talk about it now. We can talk after church.\"\n\nNow, I was really worried. Apparently, I was the cause of the bad mood. My fears were confirmed when he came around to get my door but didn't take my hand. We walked silently into the building. Mark and Nathan waved to us from the seats that they had saved but Andy ignored them and sat in a seat at the very back. I sat next to him feeling sad and confused. I shrugged at the guys and they turned around as the music started. The meeting began and I tried to concentrate but it was difficult. Saying a silent prayer for Andy seemed to be all I could do at the moment.\n\nI was fighting distraction as I tried listening to the Sunday School lesson with him rigid at my side. Relief Society was a little better but only because it was easier to focus without him right there. After church, Andy walked me to his car to begin our talk. He fidgeted with his keys for a few minutes, so I began.\n\n\"Okay, so what's going on?\"\n\n\"You know that I work most weekends and it has never seemed to bother you before,\" he paused and I nodded my head for him to continue. Still he hesitated, \"Are you seeing someone else?\"\n\n\"Why would you think that?\"\n\nHe didn't answer, just continued on with his thoughts. \"I mean... I know we haven't talked about being exclusive but I thought that we were.\" He sighed and looked away.\n\n\"So did I.\" I still didn't understanding where this was coming from. \"I haven't been dating anyone but you.\"\n\n\"What about Nathan?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" I said stunned\n\n\"Nathan said that you guys went out last night.\"\n\n\"Yeah, he was sad, so I tried to cheer him up. It was just friends hanging out.\"\n\nHe sighed and shook his head slightly, \"Megan, when it is just the two of you it looks a lot like a date.\"\n\n\"Well it wasn't.\" I said raising my voice. \"So what? I can't help my friends because we're dating exclusively? That's not fair.\"\n\n\"Of course you should help your friends. Just try not to date them.\"\n\n\"It wasn't a date!\" My voice filled the corner of our parking area and we both looked round to see if anyone heard. I lowered my voice, zipped up my hoodie and said, \"I'm done talking about this.\"\n\nAndy sighed again, \"Okay, maybe we need some time to think. I don't want to fight with you.\"\n\nI turned to walk away hoping that he would stop me. \"I'll just walk home with my roommates then.\" He didn't answer, just got in his car and drove away.\n\nI walked home by myself, not in the mood to talk to anyone else. I hated that he didn't believe me. I was angry with Andy and a little upset with Nathan, too. It made so much sense to me; why was Andy being so stubborn about this? The beauties of the changing fall trees, which had delighted me for weeks, were lost to me now as I grumbled, looking at the sidewalk. I grew grumpier with each step. Maybe relationships were more trouble than they were worth.\n\n* * *\n\nThe next few days passed in a similar way. Though I was still upset, I tried unsuccessfully not to let it interfere with my life. Tuesday evening Jackie bounced into the kitchen. \"Do you always have to be so cheerful?\" I griped.\n\nShe stopped and looked me over carefully, \"That's not like you, Megan. What's up?\"\n\nGuilt shot through me and I turned to apologize. Instead, I spilled everything about the fight with Andy. When I'd finished, I added my own editorial, \"He is being such a jerk about it! It's totally silly to think that I was out with Nathan on a date!\"\n\nJackie scrunched her face up in a frown for a moment the slowly said, \"Megan, I can see Andy's point. It really looks like a date, even if you didn't mean for it to be one.\"\n\n\"But what do looks have to do with anything?\"\n\n\"Well, have you stopped to wonder if Nathan thought it was a date?\"\n\nWhat? Of course, he wouldn't think that. We're just buddies and he knows that I'm dating Andy. Suddenly, I wasn't sure of anything. \"Oh, no! Do you think he did?\"\n\n\"I couldn't say, but what if other people saw you that night. Would they think it was a date?\"\n\nI was starting to feel a little small, \"Probably,\" I admitted.\n\n\"How would you feel if someone told you that they saw Andy out with another girl?\"\n\n\"Sad, and a little jealous, I guess.\"\n\n\"Now how would you feel if the girl was someone you knew well and you also knew that Andy really liked her?\"\n\n\"Worse. Oh, it does look bad doesn't it?\"\n\nJackie didn't say anything. She just looked at me with those all too knowing eyes. How did such wisdom wind up there of all places? I mean Jackie is great and all, but I wouldn't have pegged her for a relationship guru.\n\n\"But wait does that mean that I have to watch everything I do and change who I am just so that I don't offend Andy? Shouldn't he trust me?\"\n\n\"I don't think it will be as hard as all that. Just think before you act. You like to plan. Next time invite another friend along and then there will be two of you to do the cheering up. I'm always available... unfortunately.\"\n\nI smiled at her and gave her a big hug. \"Thanks, Jackie. You are really much better at this relationship stuff than I am.\"\n\n\"Those who can't do, teach.\"\n\nNow I needed to figure out how I was going to approach Andy. Was he still really mad? Saying sorry was going to take some planning because I didn't know that I had anything to be sorry for until a minute ago. I sat down at the computer after dinner and wrote him a letter then I deleted the whole thing because some things need to be done in person. It was too late to go over, so I made my plan to see him the next night. What was it that Mark called it? 'Eating crow'? I would have the whole next day to work up my appetite for that meal.\n\nPretend conversations played in my head all day with different responses from Andy. It was becoming a bit of an obsession, but thankfully, I was going to get it over with soon. These last couple of days had been bad enough for me. Despite my initial thoughts about relationships not being worth it, I really missed him. How had my life gotten so complicated?\n\nI stood on the doorstep of D41 waiting for them to answer it and tapping my foot. It was time to straighten this out. If Nathan was home, maybe Andy and I would have to go somewhere else to talk. It was going to be awkward enough without having an audience and I still wasn't sure if Nathan thought it was a date.\n\nMark answered the door. He seemed surprised and pleased to see me. I guessed that he had been dealing with a grumpy roommate too. I wondered if I should recommend Jackie as someone to commiserate with. \"Is Andy here?\"\n\n\"Sure, Megan. Come on in and I'll get him.\"\n\nI shifted my weight from foot to foot wondering what to do if Andy was still really mad. Andy came out of his room looking a little disheveled. \"Megan?\"\n\n\"I hoped we could talk about things.\"\n\n\"I'm really sorry,\" he began, \"I shouldn't have gotten so upset.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry too. I didn't think about how you would feel.\"\n\n\"I don't want you to change for me, I'm sorry it seemed like I was asking you too.\"\n\nI almost laughed, this was not going the way I had expected at all. \"I will try to be more careful in the future because I don't want to hurt you again.\"\n\nWe had closed the gap between us now and were hugging for the first time in days. I laid my head on his shoulder and sighed contentedly. \"I'm glad you came over,\" he said. \"I missed you.\"\n\n\"I missed you, too.\"\n\nMark walked through the room at that moment, shrinking himself down as if to not be noticed. \"Sorry, I have an appointment,\" he said as he passed through with his jacket in hand. Andy and I laughed.\n\n* * *\n\nAndy drove me to the airport the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. I was almost dreading going home; partly because I would miss him, and partly because I knew the chaos that awaited me. Family chaos could be fun and I really wanted to see everyone. There were so many final preparations for the wedding that my family had decided to forgo the traditional Thanksgiving meal, lest we put Mom in the hospital. Dad was taking us all out for Chinese food instead.\n\nFor my part, there was a list waiting for me of at least 20 things I needed to do before the reception on Saturday night. No doubt, there would be other things that came up too. It would be good to be home. I wished that Andy could meet all of my family.\n\nI gave Andy a quick kiss on the cheek and he hugged my shoulders because my arms where full with my carryon luggage: a bag of clothes, and the wedding present. I had looked all over for just the right picture for George and Lindsey. I had barely gotten it framed in time. Everyone should have a picture of Christ in their home and this one was my favorite.\n\nAndy had endured a lot of shopping the past couple of weeks with the wedding presents and the perfect shoes to match the bridesmaid dress. I liked shoe shopping about as much as I liked going to the oncologist but some things couldn't be avoided. At least with Andy along the shopping was tolerable.\n\nThe flight seemed quick and it wasn't long before I was hugging Dad. As we drove home, I got the rundown of how everything was going. \"I told your mom that if I sit down on one more wedding project, I am going to Uncle Carl's until things settle. Those corsage pins are pretty painful.\"\n\n\"Oh, Dad!\"\n\n\"Don't laugh. You've escaped it all and don't think I haven't noticed. I feel like the captain sitting next to the mutineer.\"\n\n\"I didn't mutiny and I haven't abandoned the ship. See, I came back to sink with it.\"\n\n\"Okay, I guess you're right but if you suggest any last minute good ideas you're dead to me.\"\n\n\"Have there been a lot of last minute ideas?\"\n\n\"You have no idea. I don't think your mother has slept an entire night in over a month.\"\n\n\"Consider me your most loyal sailor. I will swab the deck, take orders, and have no good ideas.\"\n\n\"That's my girl. I knew I could count on you.\"\n\nI laughed. \"I'm not really sure it that's a compliment or not.\" His return smile added to my tally for the week. I had a goal to get at least one smile from every member of the family while I was home. I was beginning to think that my stressed out mom might be a hard egg to crack.\n\n\"So how is school going?\"\n\nIt was PPI time. Dad was always good at getting those in whenever I visited. I gave him the run down on my classes and my grades. The questions about my social life for once had answers. I tried my best to explain Andy and our relationship, leaving the recent upset out of it. He was not satisfied with simple explanations and pumped me for details.\n\n\"How long have you been dating? Is he respectful? What is his major? Is he a returned missionary? How did you meet? Does he have a car? Do you really like him? I'm not going to have to put up with another wedding this year, am I?\"\n\n\"Don't get so excited, Dad. I don't think you have to worry about anything. He is my first boyfriend, after all. But if you do have to plan for a wedding, I will give you plenty of notice so that you can move to Uncle Carl's where it is safe.\"\n\n\"Good girl.\"\n\nA chilly breeze met my face as I climbed out of the car. Usually it was warmer this time of year. \"I hope it warms up for the wedding. My dress has short sleeves. I assume we are doing outside photos?\"\n\n\"Don't assume anything at this point. I stopped trying to predict the actual events about two weeks ago.\" Dad grabbed my bags. \"Let's go inside; Mom has a list for us, I'm sure.\"\n\nThanksgiving went by in a blur, there almost wasn't time to miss Andy... almost. Braiding Kelly's long, beautiful hair was the first thing on my list for Friday morning. She was blessed not to have the fuzzy mess that I had inherited. Kelly's dress was a light pink with small burgundy roses all over it and I placed little pink roses in her hair after it was braided.\n\nHeated debate had ensued over how I should wear my hair but after an evening of playing with it, they'd reached a consensus. I could wear it any way I wanted, as long as I added some of the baby pink roses. Thankfully, I didn't have to try to wrestle my hair into an intricate braid, although if the goal was to make sure I looked silly so the bride would shine in comparison then that would be the way to go. I thought of my beautiful, blond, petite future sister in law and doubted she would need to resort to such tactics.\n\nSure enough, when George and Lindsey exited the temple in the morning sunlight they were glowing. George looked really happy and I was so excited for him. They were met by a large group of people who wanted to give hugs and congratulations. Forcing my way to the front of the mob, I gave my big, grown-up brother a hug. I gave Lindsey a hug and welcomed her to the family. She was crying a little and George had tears in his eyes, too.\n\nThey, of course, weren't the only ones; both Mom and Dad were starting to cry. Wow. Funny how much happiness a marriage can bring. I thought back over the few days that I had been fighting with Andy. It had felt so good to be with him again. I guess it only makes sense that knowing you never had to say goodbye would have this effect. The more I thought about it, the more I decided it would make anyone overwhelmingly happy to have such a blessing. My joy for George and Lindsey doubled.\n\nI watched their beaming faces and realized that I should have tried to get smiles from them before the wedding. I was never going to have a chance to create one now. Every smile they had over the next few days would be for each other. Oh, well, small price to pay, at least I got to see them so happy.\n\nThe weather had warmed up so the pictures, although long, were not a problem. The happy couple ate lunch at a nearby restaurant with the two families and then they went off on their own while we finished preparations for the reception the next day.\n\nMost of the final work was just baking cookies and decorating the cultural hall the next morning. I put a batch of cookies in the oven and Dad made Mom take a nap. While the cookies were baking, I called Andy.\n\n\"Hi, Megan. How did the wedding go?\"\n\n\"It was wonderful. They both seem so happy. How was your Thanksgiving?\"\n\n\"Crazy but good. Mark's family is a trip. We spent this morning making a snow fort.\"\n\n\"Did you have a snowball fight?\"\n\n\"Not yet. Caleb has been making snowballs all afternoon. I think Mark and I are in trouble after dinner.\"\n\n\"Sounds fun; wish I could be there.\"\n\n\"I wish you could, too. I miss you.\"\n\n\"Me, too. You should have seen me trying to get all the baby roses out of my hair and I get to do it all over again tomorrow.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you looked beautiful. Did the twins behave themselves?\"\n\n\"Funny you should mention them, I haven't seen them much. I think they are maintaining a low profile at the moment so they don't get put to work.\"\n\n\"Mark and I are planning on picking you up from the airport on our way back Sunday night. We'll be a little cramped in Mark's truck, is that okay?\"\n\nI giggled, \"Bummer; an excuse to snuggle.\"\n\nHe laughed too, \"Good point. This is a better plan than I'd realized.\"\n\nThe timer for the cookies went off. \"I have to go. There is still a lot to do. Take care.\"\n\n\"You, too. Bye.\"\n\nI smiled as I hung up the phone. Things were going good with Andy. We hadn't used the \"L\" word but that made it a lot simpler. I wasn't sure that I felt that way yet, but I was starting to feel something. It wasn't the plan to get into a serious relationship this year but it wasn't a bad bonus. Luckily, I had been wrong about the whole ruined friendship thing.\n\nOne reception down, and it was quick kisses and hugs goodbye at the airport. The reception had gone off without a hitch. The beautiful couple danced, visited with friends, and then left for their honeymoon with streamers trailing from their car. I was a little sad that I hadn't had a moment alone with George in all the chaos. I guess that was just the way things were, now that he was all grown up. I wondered about that and whether marriage was some final step in that process. But then there were plenty of grownups who weren't married. So what was it that made him seem different to me?\n\nThe time had gone so fast that my head was spinning. I closed my eyes when the plane took off and thought about my PPI with Dad, which he'd finished on the way to the airport. I'd had to admit that I had gotten a little behind for a while with my school work but that I was all caught up now. He'd asked me about church. I talked to him a little about my calling and some of the things I was learning, like how my last visiting teaching appointment had resulted in a good gospel discussion. The Spirit had been really strong. Dad gave me the usual 'keep up the good work' and 'try a little' harder speeches where appropriate.\n\nThe plane trip seemed long because I was sitting more than I had since I stepped off the plane in Phoenix. I closed my eyes and replayed the smiles I'd gathered. First, there had been Dad's on the way home from the airport but I had collected two others from him for helping Mom out.\n\nMom had managed an exhausted but genuine smile towards the end of the reception. We were sitting at a table in a darker corner of the room. She'd kicked her heels off and was resting a bit. She wasn't up to grilling me for information about my life but was more in a reminiscing mood. By the time she'd recounted several George/Megan stories, she was smiling.\n\nDrew had given me a smile while we listened to music in his room. I think at the time, we were actually hiding from Mom. He has a pretty nice system and we each had on a big pairs of headphones, the kind that look like earmuffs.\n\nMatt's smile had come while we were playing basketball in the driveway. He was a very aggressive player. Though, I'd had lots of practice lately. Matt was more than willing to get in my way and knock me down if needed to get the ball. It was while he was helping me up off the ground that he smiled and said, \"It's fun having you home.\"\n\nKelly's smile was much easier than I'd expected. I'd gotten it the minute I walked in the door Wednesday night. She pushed her way through the crowd of family in the kitchen and jumped into my arms. There was such an age gap between us that we'd never been very close. Her welcome brought tears to my eyes and I gave her a proper Cole family style hug.\n\nThe trip lagged on, and trying to sleep was not working. Andy and Mark would be waiting for me when I walked through the terminal and I could feel my excitement building. I felt like we had so much to catch up on and I couldn't wait to hear the results of that snowball fight.\nChapter 9\n\nWe walked through the busy airport avoiding the crowd that waited for their luggage. Mark carried my only bag, as I walked with Andy's arm around my shoulders. It was dark and cold in the parking garage so we hurried to climb in the truck.\n\n\"How long have you guys been waiting?\" I asked, surprised at how cold the inside of the truck was.\n\nMark laughed and looked over at Andy. \"We've been here for a couple of hours. He was worried we wouldn't get here in time unless we left really early this morning.\"\n\nAndy looked sheepish, \"I didn't want you to have to wait.\" Then he slapped Mark on the back of the head. \"Thanks, friend.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm glad to see you,\" I said, scooting over into Andy's side so that Mark could reach the stick shift.\n\nWith the three of us in such a small space, it didn't take long for us to warm up. I got to hear all about the holiday at the Coles' house, complete with a blow by blow account of the snowball fight.\n\nCaleb had indeed been triumphant, with a little help from Brother Cole. Andy was relieved that Rebekah hadn't followed him around like a lost puppy, and a little disappointed too, if I judged his expression right. I knew from keeping in touch with Rebekah that she was settling down into her own social life now, and didn't need a crush on an out of reach guy.\n\nListening to Andy and Mark tell stories back and forth was wonderful. They would stop and correct each other or just jump in adding a bit, as they went. Their friendship showed in every interaction they had. It felt homey. I laid my head on Andy's shoulder and just enjoyed the sound of their voices.\n\n* * *\n\nBack to school had me working on some end of the semester projects, one of which was a budget for a pretend business. I was having a hard time figuring in all the employee benefits. Andy, who had a better head for numbers than I did, was able to help with some of it, but he was really busy with his classes too. We managed to talk at least every day, but with finals approaching it would probably get worse before it got better.\n\nI had my nose in a text book when my phone rang. Andy was at the library researching a paper so it probably wasn't him. This was a number I recognized. It was Rebekah. Excitedly, I answered, \"Hello?\"\n\n\"Megan? Hi, it's Rebekah.\"\n\n\"Rebekah, what's up? I haven't talked to you in a long time. How are things going with Jeremy?\"\n\n\"Oh, okay I guess. He sits next to me in English now. Hey, listen. I am calling about Mark. Micah is in the hospital and Mark is really upset. Mom and Dad are concerned he will try to come home and get behind in his classes and at work.\"\n\n\"I can imagine,\" I said, surprised he was still here. \"Is Micah going to be okay? What's going on?\"\n\n\"The doctors say that he is responding to the antibiotics, but he will be in for a few more days. He has pneumonia.\"\n\n\"Is there anything I can do?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is why I am calling. Could you try to cheer Mark up? I told my parents you were the perfect one for the job. He is working tonight but he should be home around 7:30. We were supposed to call him but if you could get him out, maybe you could just give him the update.\"\n\n\"Consider it done. I'll make sure that he relaxes a bit and that he stays here.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Megan. How is your love life going?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I have been seeing Andy a lot.\"\n\n\"Oh, he's cute,\" she said, her voice going up an octave in her excitement.\n\n\"Yeah, he is. It's 6:30 already, I had better go. I have a lot to do. I'll be praying for Micah. Keep in touch, 'kay.\"\n\n\"Okay, bye.\"\n\nWhat could we do on a Thursday night? Mark would probably be tired after working an 8 hour shift so anything energetic was out of the question. Time for the old standby. Remembering that I needed to think things through, I dialed Andy's number. It rang only once and I heard a whispered, \"Megan, hi.\"\n\n\"Sorry to bother you, Andy, but we have a mission of mercy. Do you want to go to a movie with Mark and me tonight?\"\n\n\"What? Mark's working.\" Then, with a hurt sound in his voice, he said, \"you're taking him to the movies?\"\n\n\"I'm hoping that we're taking him to the movies.\" It was kind of sweet and a little silly for Andy to be jealous. I gave him the rundown of the conversation I'd had with Rebekah. I even told him that she'd said he was really cute, just to tease him.\n\n\"Okay, pick me up in front of the law building at 7:45. I will try to get as much done here as I can.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Andy, we'll be there.\"\n\nAt 7:20, I parked myself on D41's front step and waited. About five minutes later Mark's truck pulled into the lot. Even in those five minutes, I had frozen through. It really wasn't much of a night for going out. He approached the apartment looking both cold and tired. He had his coat wrapped around his thin scrubs trying to keep the wind off. His head was down and his shoulders were hunched so he didn't see me until he was at his door.\n\n\"Megan, what are you doing out here? It's freezing!\"\n\n\"I am kidnapping you. Go get changed we're going out.\"\n\nHe was clearly taken aback. \"That's really nice of you, but I am expecting a really important call. Maybe some other time.\"\n\n\"Go get changed,\" I insisted, allowing him to pass in out of the cold. He left the door open so that I could follow him into the warm apartment. My face started to burn as it warmed up. It was a quiet tonight. Emily and John sat on the couch each with a book in their laps studying. \"Rebekah called,\" I continued. \"Micah is responding to the antibiotics. They think he will only be a couple of more days in the hospital.\" He sighed and it seemed as if his shoulders lowered several inches. I continued, \"They won't be calling because they know that you are with me. Now go get ready.\"\n\n\"But Megan, I am really tired and it's so cold. My truck barely warmed up on the way home.\" He was almost pouting, this was so unlike him.\n\n\"Mark, if I don't take you out and get you to have some fun, Rebekah will be mad at me. Hurry up; we have to meet Andy in ten minutes.\"\n\nSulking, he headed off to change. I sat down at the table to wait. Emily looked up from her book and asked, \"Where are you guys going?\"\n\n\"Just to the movies, there's a new comedy at the dollar theater.\"\n\n\"Sounds fun.\"\n\nMark returned faster than I would have expected, layered in two shirts and a sweater. \"Don't worry,\" I said, smirking at him, \"I came prepared.\" I held up a large thermos filled with hot cocoa. \"It helps to warm the insides too.\" I received a tired smile for my effort. It didn't quite light his whole face, but it warmed me, so I counted it.\n\nHe held an arm up motioning toward the door, \"Shall we?\"\n\nOnce we were in the truck with the heater trying to make a dent in the cold, I opened the thermos and handed him a cup. \"Thanks, now what exactly are we doing?\"\n\n\"Something boring I'm afraid... movie. I figured you would be too tired for anything else.\"\n\n\"Sounds perfect.\" His grumbling was starting to give way to his casual banter as he warmed up with the cocoa.\n\n\"Sorry about Micah.\"\n\n\"Yeah, poor kid can't catch much of a break. He was in for pneumonia when I was on my mission.\"\n\n\"I bet that was hard,\" I said, stating the obvious.\n\n\"I just worry that with all of his other challenges that he won't make it through, and...\" he trailed off.\n\n\"And you won't be there.\" I finished for him. \"He's going to be okay, so deep breath. Let's go get Andy.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nI gave him directions to where Andy said he would be. We pulled up just long enough to let him slide in next to me and close the door against the cold again. The blast of air that entered the truck when he opened the door was bone chilling. It really wasn't a good night to be out.\n\nI was squished in the middle with my legs to the right side so that Mark could still move the gearshift. Andy didn't seem to mind. He put his arm around me and cuddled me into his side. I wondered how long he'd been waiting for us. He needed to warm up and the cocoa would be just the thing, but I couldn't reach it. It would only be a few minutes to the theater. I could deal with his cold, slick winter jacket now raising the goose bumps on my arms.\n\nThe movie was a total flop. I sat between the guys trying to keep them from throwing popcorn at each other like adolescents. I put up with the occasional kernel in my hair because the point of tonight was to get Mark out for a little fun. The smile on his face as he scored a cheap shot was definitely genuine, and he seemed more relaxed.\n\nAndy was trying to take the high road and watch the movie. At least, that's what I thought, until I felt him stick popcorn down Mark's sweater with the hand he had wrapped behind my shoulders. Did he seriously think I wouldn't notice?\n\nI felt a little bad for the person who had to sweep the theater after we left, but at least I was surrounded by grins. The two of them kicked at each other and shoved playfully all the way to the truck.\n\nMark dropped us off at Andy's car on campus before heading home. You could just see the stress lifted from his face. I was glad that the evening had helped. I gave him a hug and thanked him for coming with us. \"Anytime,\" he said, then threw one more piece of popcorn, he had just found in his sweater, at Andy. Despite being more relaxed and it getting late, I was sure his family would be getting a phone call from him tonight.\n\nAndy and I walked hand in hand to his car quickly because the wind was still bitter. He opened my door and then hurried around to get in and start up the heater. \"That was fun tonight. We did a good thing,\" he said, leaning across the car and kissing my frozen, chapped cheek. The cocoa was still warm, so we took a few minutes to have some while the car warmed up.\n\n\"Yeah, nothing like going to the movies with a couple of boys.\" I tried acting annoyed, but I couldn't help smiling. He just laughed.\n\n\"You should have seen us as companions.\"\n\n\"I hope that your mission apartment was still standing when you were transferred.\"\n\n\"Mostly. Actually, we were a good team; we got a lot of work done.\"\n\n\"That doesn't surprise me at all. You're still are a good team.\"\n\n\"You and I make a really good team, too.\" He was looking into my eyes. I covered my mouth with my hand as a small giggle escaped. Why did I always loose it when things turned serious?\n\n\"It seems that way,\" I said shyly. Okay, I was feeling stupid now. I wasn't good with this feelings stuff.\n\n\"It was kind of fun cheering up Mark tonight. It was almost like being part of a family together. I bet you will make a great mom.\"\n\nOkay, how had we gotten to this? I wasn't expecting a serious discussion just now, not with popcorn in my hair. Gulping, I realized that for the first time in three years I needed to explain something important. It had never seemed that important before, but suddenly it was the most important thing I could say. It seemed only fair to tell him, as we were getting more serious.\n\n\"Andy, I can't have children.\" There, I said it. That wasn't so bad.\n\n\"What do you mean? How could you possibly know that?\" He was shocked, but not horrified; that was good.\n\n\"I had cancer.\" I decided to keep it simple. \"After the surgery I had, I am sure that I can't have kids.\" I smiled weakly at him hoping that he would smile back. He didn't and I wished I knew what was going on behind those wide eyes.\n\nWhen Andy did speak, it was in a sputter, \"That... must have been... hard for you.\"\n\nHow thoughtful to think of me instead of how it might change things between us. I relaxed. It had been hard. Mostly the feelings of the 16 year old me had been excitement that my monthly menstruations had ended and then a feeling of being some kind of freak because they had.\n\nThe surgery had been private and very few people knew. I really had never thought to be upset about the whole kid thing. That life had seemed so far away. Sitting here in the now too warm car, I was beginning to see what I was losing. Unbidden, a picture of a little boy with sandy hair and big green eyes that sparkled like the ones staring at me now, danced in my mind. \"Yeah, it is... hard, sometimes,\" I admitted\u2013like now.\n\n\"Well, there is still adoption, Mark's adopted you know.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I think he mentioned that once.\"\n\nHe reached across and stroked my cheek. I yawned. It had been a long day. \"I should take you home, it's getting late.\" The drive home was quiet. He didn't seem to want to talk about it. He walked me to my door and gave me a brief but sweet kiss on the lips. \"I still need to work on that paper. I'll call you tomorrow if I can get it done.\"\n\n\"Sorry to pull you away tonight. Good luck finishing it.\" I waved and walked in, feeling a little sick. Something just seemed off. I wasn't sure if it was my shock or that his eyes didn't sparkle when we said goodnight.\n\n* * *\n\nAndy didn't call. The hope that he was just working on his paper didn't erase the sinking feeling in my gut. I took solace in a girls' movie night. We made cookies and watched a couple of old Hitchcock films. I loved how suspenseful Hitchcock movies could get without getting too scary. There was enough scary in my life just now.\n\nFinals were looming in the near future and I had been wishing for some extra time to prepare. It seemed if things kept going the way they were with Andy, my wish might come true. Already it had been nearly two days and I still hadn't heard from him. Was it really about his paper or was he avoiding me?\n\nSaturday, I hit the books. When studying failed, I tried distracting myself with wrapping the few presents I had purchased or made for Christmas. Just last week I had worried about missing Andy too much when I went home for the holiday, but tonight it seemed like I couldn't get home fast enough. It was time to take a break from the whole adult thing for a while. I wanted to be a kid.\n\nThere was loud conversation noise coming through the door when I woke up from an unexpected doze. I sat up, my hair all disheveled, and wiped the sleep from my eyes. Kristen and Melissa were returning with two other girls that I only knew by sight and four guys, one I recognized right away as Tony, Kristen's boyfriend.\n\n\"I'll get the ice cream,\" Melissa said over her shoulder as she walked to the kitchen.\n\n\"Hi, Megan.\" Kristen was heading for the cupboard for the bowls and spoons.\n\nI laughed to myself thinking of a similar situation in D41. We had been playing 'Sorry' and Andy had announced. \"We have some ice cream, would you like some?\" I had said yes and then he added, \"You just need your own bowl and spoon.\" The guys' apartment was definitely not as well stocked as ours.\n\n\"How was the concert?\"\n\n\"It was great. There was this one number...\" Kristen began, but she was overtaken by everyone else trying to talk at once about the number in question. This dissolved into conversation that I really didn't understand so I excused myself and went to bed.\n\n* * *\n\nOur usual rides greeted us the next morning, if not with the usual smiles. I pasted a grin on my face and rode in Andy's car making small talk with the Jackie in the back seat. Andy was quiet most of the way.\n\nWhen we got there, I noticed that church was getting crowded. Looking around, I could see that we had picked up a few extra people who seemed to be attached to someone in the ward. There were quite a few rings as well. Of course, we were also losing people. John was the most noticeable absence. He was attending church in Emily's ward now.\n\nAndy had walked in with us, but had stopped to talk with a group of men in the hall. When he entered, he came over and sat in the vacant seat next to me and distractedly flipped through his manual. Despite the fact that I had been nervous for days, I was content not to disturb him. I wasn't ready for that conversation yet, so I turned to Nathan.\n\n\"How are those mission papers coming?\"\n\n\"I have to wait until next semester but I'm starting the process.\" Nathan was hoping for somewhere exotic. I hoped that he would be happy where ever he went and it would probably be a good idea if it was some remote place that didn't get ESPN.\n\nSacrament Meeting was starting. I reached over and took Andy's hand. It was a little sweaty, but I didn't care. They always kept the building so hot anyway. He pulled it away to grab the hymn book as the opening song began. That was reasonable, I told myself, no need to panic.\n\nI was too distracted to listen in church. The three hours seemed to be over in no time. Jackie and her friend, Alisha, who had sat beside me in Relief Society walked home with me. Andy had a meeting after church. Normally, I would wait for him, but things weren't normal just now. The girls seemed like a good excuse. \"I'll see you later,\" I called. \"I am going to walk home with Jackie and Alisha.\" He had waved me on as he was sitting down to his meeting.\n\nIt was a bit chilly, but the wind wasn't as bad as it had been. The walk was only about a half mile, but it was a bit of a hike in heels, especially where the snow hadn't been cleared completely. Jackie seemed to keep warm by gushing about her favorite subject, boys. She had gone on a date with a guy named Carson. I enjoyed the distraction and it was very entertaining to hear what Jackie considered a proper date report. Not a detail was neglected. It never occurred to me to notice what aftershave the guy was wearing or if he wore a CTR ring on his right hand, but to Jackie the beauty was in the details.\n\nI walked through the door of my apartment and flopped on the couch with a huff. \"What's up with you and Andy?\" Jackie asked as she flopped down next to me. Other people were noticing. That was a bad sign.\n\n\"I'm not sure; we've been out of contact for the last few days. I'm just giving him some space.\" I was pretty sure I knew what the problem was, I had thought of little else since of our conversation. I just wasn't in the habit of sharing that information.\n\n\"You're handling it very well. If that were me, I would be so worried.\" Gee thanks, Jackie.\n\n\"So are you going to go out with Carson again?\" Changing the subject seemed like a good idea.\n\n\"Oh, yes, if he calls me. I think he had fun. I had fun.\" All the certainty had left her voice and I sympathized. It was hard to wait around on someone else.\n\n\"Well, if he is smart, he'll call because you are awesome!\" I said with enthusiasm, then I escaped to my room to change. I'd considered hiding in my bedroom because I wasn't much for talking at the moment, but I was even more against being left with my thoughts. Emerging from my room in sweats, I hollered out, \"Hey I'm going to make some cocoa. Want some?\"\n\n\"Sounds good,\" Jackie said, joining me.\n\nI carefully steered the conversation to classes and the upcoming finals. Jackie was especially fun to talk to right now because in preparation for her ASL final, she was signing as she spoke. Her hands and her expressions were animated as she talked about the teaching materials she was designing. I had seen a lot of poster boards and markers in her hands lately, but I hadn't really taken the time to notice what she was doing.\n\n\"Hey, can I see them?\" I asked. Her face lit up as she bounced down the hall. It was a little late in the day for counting my first smile, but I suspected it was going to be that kind of week.\n\nI spent the rest of the afternoon catching up with roommates. Melissa's final concert was scheduled for Friday night. Andy and I had made plans last week to go. Those plans seemed uncertain now. She was nervous which surprised me because she was so diligent about practicing and she had a lot of natural talent.\n\nKristen was buried in homework and spending every free moment with Tony. It occurred to me that Melissa may just be feeling a little lonely. I had seen Kristen give her steady encouragement for so long, how had I missed its absence?\n\nJackie received two phone calls that evening. Mark was the first and I couldn't imagine what he would be calling her about. Was it a date? I was pretty sure Mark was one of those guys who was having trouble adjusting after mission life, but maybe he was going to start dating. The idea seemed odd to me; I had never seen him on a date before. I felt a little silly hovering around the hallway waiting for her to come out of our room. I was desperate for any news from D41, and I didn't feel welcome there at the moment.\n\nJackie opened the door and surprise spread across her face when she almost ran into me. I tried to make it look like I was just coming out of the bathroom. At least I hadn't put my ear to the door. \"So what's up?\" I asked trying to sound casual.\n\n\"FHE stuff. Mark made arrangements for us to carol where he works tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Oh, that sounds really great. I love caroling.\" Relieved was an understatement. I couldn't deal with more things changing right now. With Andy giving me the cold shoulder, it was as if my world was upside down. Mark dating would just be too weird.\nChapter 10\n\nMonday night, we all got on our festive clothes and headed to the parking lot. Andy sometimes came to FHE with me, but I doubted he would be there tonight. I climbed into one of the waiting cars, excited for the activity. Melissa was bringing her flute. Holiday music was always a favorite of mine and I couldn't wait to hear the performance.\n\nI was a little embarrassed when Mark walked over to the car and requested that I ride with him instead. Ignoring the giggles, I crossed my fingers that he would have some news on the Andy front and climbed out of the car. We were just pulling out of the parking lot, when he turned to me. \"What is going on with you and Andy? I know I'm being nosy, but I have to know. He has been walking around in a fog for days.\"\n\nHe was being nosy, but after the initial frustration, I turned to him again as an ally. Maybe together we could figure this thing out. \"He didn't tell you?\"\n\n\"No. First, you guys seemed happy and to hear Andy talk, you were getting serious. Then out of the blue he isn't himself and you guys are barely even talking.\" He shook his head and I felt fresh guilt for causing Andy and apparently Mark pain. \"Did you break up with him?\"\n\n\"I don't think so. He stopped talking to me before I could figure it out. It isn't looking good though.\" I said in my smallest voice feeling dejected, as I admitted the almost certain truth.\n\nMark's tone became softer and he probed, \"What happened?\"\n\n\"I told him about my cancer.\"\n\n\"Why should that matter?\"\n\n\"There is more than I told you before; I can't have kids.\" I looked at him and he seemed to freeze in place but only for a second.\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"What do you mean 'and?' It's a lot for him to deal with.\" I defended.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Megan. I just meant...\" He shook his head in frustration. \"So what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"Give him some more time, I guess. But it's driving me crazy! I'm not sure how much longer I can wait. I wish he would just get it over with.\" I was starting to cry. \"Can we change the subject, please?\" Mark pulled the car over to the side of the road and drew me into a hug. After a moment, I wiggled free. I didn't need to have a breakdown now. I needed to be cheerful for the caroling. I wiped my eyes and asked about Christmas at the Cole's.\n\nMark drove the rest of the way to the hospital talking about his Christmas plans. The snow fort had survived and he was hoping for a rematch. I had wiped my face and was smiling, thanks to the images Mark painted of his eventual take down of his younger brothers.\n\n* * *\n\nThe hospital where Mark worked was a good sized place. We followed him in, huddling a bit together for warmth and also because it was unfamiliar. Mark, of course, walked in as if he owned the place and led us directly to the dining hall where we would be singing. A small crowd of residents were already sitting there waiting for us. Even more were coming in as we arrived. I looked over the group, noticing the ones in wheelchairs especially. Most seemed to have one foot rest up or even both and I pictured their stocking feet helping to propel them along. I looked them in the eyes and smiled. I was glad I had come despite my outburst of feeling. Maybe this was what I needed.\n\nMark took in the faces as well and a few of them lit up when they saw him. He left us standing around in our group and walked forward to talk to a few. Carefully, he moved someone's foot out of the way so that he could lower the footrest of their chair. He readjusted blanket throws over a couple of people and even got a hug from a lady that looked a little like my grandma.\n\nA couple braver members of our group followed Mark's lead and began to shake hands with the residents and exchange hellos. I hesitated, too engrossed in watching the scene to move. Turning back to scan our group, Mark's eyes fell on me. He motioned me forward with his hand and I walked to him.\n\nMark pulled me by the arm and led me out of the room. \"There are a few residents missing. Come help me.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said following after him. I knew he was just trying to distract me, but I let him.\n\n\"Now Mr. Wallace is a little cranky, but he likes pretty girls, so I will let you get him.\"\n\nI gulped and remembered the experience I'd had when I was a Beehive. Being yelled at by an elderly lady at a nursing home is hard to forget. I wasn't sure what I had done. The staff told me that she was just lonely and not to take it personally. Still, it had scared me.\n\nMark stopped at a doorway, \"Mr. Wallace? This is Megan. She wants to take you to the dining hall for some music, okay.\"\n\nMr. Wallace was a tall man dressed in brown pants and a button up green shirt. I was surprised to see that he was also wearing dress type shoes and a belt. He looked as if he could have walked in off the street. I wondered why he was in a care facility instead of his home. He turned from the window where he was standing and his sour expression changed as soon as he saw Mark. His fondness for Mark was obvious.\n\n\"What are you doing here boy? Wasn't expecting you 'til tomorrow.\"\n\n\"I'm here with some friends tonight,\" Mark said as he walked forward and pulled out the wheelchair from the corner of the room. \"This is my friend, Megan.\"\n\nMr. Wallace's eyes appraised me, \"Pretty little thing.\" He remarked.\n\nI covered my mouth with my hand to hide a smirk when Mark added, \"She's feisty too. You behave okay.\"\n\nMr. Wallace waved his hand in a calming motion at Mark and sat in the wheelchair. \"He's all yours,\" he said turning back to me. \"I'm going to go and pick up Mrs. Smith. I'll meet you back in the dining hall. You can find your way, right?\"\n\n\"No problem,\" I said, stepping forward. \"Hello, Mr. Wallace. Are you ready for some music?\"\n\n\"Again? Blasted carolers! The place is packed with 'em this time of year. Don't none of them come back to visit when things are really boring around here.\"\n\nI winced at his candor. I could imagine how many groups did pass through these halls at Christmas time. \"Well,\" I said brightly, \"We probably won't be the last carolers this Christmas. Still, Christmas music is really beautiful.\"\n\nHe huffed, \"Wouldn't even bother if it weren't my Marky.\"\n\nIt was hard not to laugh at the nickname. \"Well maybe you'll enjoy it.\" I wheeled him into the dining hall. The room was pretty full now, but he pointed me to the place he wanted next to the piano.\n\nOur performance was average, but it was fun to sing the familiar songs. Caught up in the moment, I felt happy doing some service. Not everyone felt the way Mr. Wallace did; it appeared that most of the crowd was enjoying themselves. Some were mouthing the words along with us as we sang. There was even one lady leading us with gusto like a choir director from her seat in the back.\n\nThe highlight of the evening was when our pianist, and Melissa performed \"Silent Night.\" There were several people in the audience with tears in their eyes and surprisingly, Mr. Wallace was one of them. During the song, Mark wandered over and crouched down, resting his hand on Mr. Wallace's. It was touching; service was definitely good for the soul. I decided that I would make an effort to visit Mr. Wallace in January, 'when life was boring around here.'\n\nTuesday night, I just couldn't wait any more. Enough time had passed and well, I just needed to know what was happening. I walked over to D41, armed with cookies. Nathan answered the door, greeted me, and then went back to his game; wait no, he was reading.\n\n\"Cookies?\" I offered. \"You're studying?\" I said, as he loaded his hand up with three cookies from the plate.\n\n\"Yeah, final tomorrow, thanks,\" he said, gesturing with the cookies in his hand and talking with his mouth full.\n\n\"Sure. Is Andy here?\" He responded by getting up and walking the few feet to knock on the bedroom door. Mark stuck his head out and I heard him tell Andy that I was here.\n\n\"Cookies?\" Mark walked out into the living room and I held the plate up for him. \"Andy will be right out, he is changing.\"\n\n\"How is Mr. Wallace?\"\n\nHe laughed, \"Well, he survived us. Asked about you today.\"\n\n\"Really?\" I was going to inquire more, but Andy came out and I was reminded of my purpose.\n\nThere was a tentative smile on his face. Nathan and Mark seemed to take some unspoken cue to retreat. Alone in the living room, I held up the plate of cookies and he shook his head politely.\n\nI sat on the couch and patted the seat next to me. \"Okay, what is up? It feels like you have been avoiding me. Did I do something?\" I blurted out, hoping that it was something that could be smoothed over and easily fixed.\n\nHe sat down beside me and put his face in his hands. I waited several minutes wondering what I should say. Finally he spoke, \"It's not you. I'm just a jerk.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" Maybe it wasn't what I thought. How could he possibly feel like a jerk? He was one of the nicest people I knew.\n\nHe paused again, as if trying to order his words. \"The other night when we were talking...\" He didn't have to tell me what night that was, it had been in my thoughts for days. \"I... I thought I could get past it, you know?\" He looked up at me for the first time, looking for some kind of answer that I didn't know how to give. \"I just can't, I've tried... I like you so...\" He trailed off shaking his head.\n\nI followed the thought to the logical conclusion, \"But it's not enough.\" I thought of that green eyed child I had pictured and knew that he should have that chance. \"It's okay,\" I said bravely. \"I understand.\" And in that moment, I did.\n\nI stood quickly and went to leave before I could cry. After that moment of understanding, I felt completely worthless. \"Don't worry about it, Andy.\" I said patting his shoulder. I opened the door, trying hard to resist the urge to run.\n\nHe called after me to wait, but I had to leave before I said something I would regret. I wiped tears from my cheeks and headed for the farthest point I could get. It was dark so my options were limited. I set my sights on the snow pile at the end of the parking lot. I was hurt and I wanted to be alone but there was something else building too \u2013 anger.\n\nI kicked at the snow bank and fumed. \"How could he treat me like that? Am I like some kind of leper just because I'm not perfect? He's right, he is a jerk!\" A couple walked by and looked at me oddly from across the road. I stopped long enough for them to be out of earshot, and then I started kicking again. It really didn't make me feel any better, but I wasn't ready to face my roommates or anyone else just yet.\n\nI walked to the laundry room hoping that the Tuesday night before finals would not be a popular time for laundry. Luckily, there were a few loads going, but no one was there. At least it would be a warm place to pull myself together before I went home. I shook my head at that word 'home' because tonight it felt like home was miles away.\n\n* * *\n\nThe next morning, most of the anger was gone, but the hurt remained. It wasn't as if I couldn't see his side of things. Whatever made me think I could have a normal life? Of course, no one would want me. At the moment, I didn't want me much either. This stupid body had betrayed me. What had been the point of surviving in the first place? All those months of enduring, for this? I knew now that no one would ever want me.\n\nI just wanted to run away. My goal now was to get through finals and get home as soon as possible. My concentration was lacking as I tried to study. Hopefully, I could keep it together long enough to pass my classes, though I wasn't sure it mattered anymore.\n\nI longed to be home. If there had been any enthusiasm left in me, I could have counted the days until Christmas the way I did as a kid, with a colorful paper chain. Instead, I turned my alarm off each morning with a sigh and a reminder to myself that I was one day closer. The week was long, but at last, I was on the plane flying away from this ruin and toward home.\n\nI had managed to avoid Andy all week except for one time. The exchange had been awkward. \"Do you still need me to drive you to the airport?\" he had asked, looking at his feet.\n\n\"No, I've made other arrangements, thanks.\" Those other arrangements had me scrambling for a couple of days. I had finally called Christy, one of my visiting teachers, and asked for her help. I just couldn't face anymore explanations. My roommates were already looking at me with pity, as the news spread. She had called me back in two hours with a ride. Someone she knew was flying out on that day. I just needed to go about four hours early. I was so grateful to her for the help.\n\n\"How are you?\" Andy had asked, daring to look at my face.\n\nI bit back an icy remark and forced a smile, \"I'm fine, and you?\"\n\n\"Surviving.\" So he was feeling a little bad; good, he should be. I said a silent prayer, willing the bitter feelings to go away. I wasn't completely over the anger, I guess. Instant answers did not appear. I turned and walked off.\n\nBut now I was going home, for Christmas, my favorite holiday. Surely, Mom would have me helping with the baking before the day was out. There was always the last minute shopping and decorating. With any luck, I could just absorb all that good family time to fortify me against the chill I was feeling now.\n\nI was not disappointed. Sure enough, Mom had me deep in holiday activities two hours after I walked in the front door. As the hour grew late, all my siblings gathered around the TV for a movie. I was scrunched in between Matt and Drew. As I tried to make a long popcorn string, the big bowl in my lap was occasionally invaded by the twins. They seemed to be eating mostly out of habit because they would cringe at its bland taste as soon as it hit their mouth.\n\nKelly jumped around the room excited for the festivities, it was a little reminiscent of Jackie and I smiled. The twins grumbled a few times as she got in the way of what they were watching. It took a while, but I finally noticed that Mom and Dad were missing from this scene of family togetherness. I pushed the popcorn bowl at Drew and stood up, careful not to crush my popcorn chain\n\nI found them in the dining room drinking a cup of cocoa and talking quietly to each other. I started to back out of the room, but they welcomed me in and Mom stood to get more cocoa. I sat across from Dad and he looked into my eyes and shook his head with a sigh that sounded like a laugh. \"You're getting old, kid. You look so tired.\"\n\n\"It has been a long day,\" a long couple of weeks actually.\n\n\"So let's get the lowdown,\" Dad had placed his elbows on the table and was leaning forward. He meant business; this would be my PPI for this trip. \"How are classes going? What grades are you expecting this semester?\"\n\nMy grades weren't going to be as stellar as I had hoped. I was pretty sure that I had bombed one of my finals because I was out of it. \"Not too bad, I guess. I really liked my recreation classes and my D&C class was interesting. I think my finance class is going to be at least a B, which I'm happy with. Plus, my checkbook has never been so organized.\"\n\n\"Good, honey,\" Mom said, handing me my cocoa. \"What about guys? You talked so much about Andy we half expected you to bring him home for Christmas.\" I winced. I hadn't thought this through. Alone time with my parents was a bad idea.\n\n\"Mom, it isn't like that. We decided to see other people, it just wasn't working out.\" This was all the detail I could supply. I was suddenly feeling as tired as Dad said I looked. Eventually the whole story would come out, just not tonight.\n\n\"How's work?\" Dad took back the questioning, giving Mom a sideways glance to make sure she was done. I was grateful that he wasn't inclined to pry any deeper on the Andy front.\n\n\"Work's good. I like the simple 'get in and get it done' work. It's not as exciting as teaching swim lessons, but I'm happy with it.\" Dad smiled at this. He had been on his college swim team and had taught us all very early. I grew up in the backyard pool and when I was old enough, giving swim lessons was the perfect summer job. Life guarding was a bit boring, but at least I was poolside.\n\n\"Are you getting to the temple?\"\n\n\"I only went twice this semester, my ward arranged dates to go, so I went on their schedule.\"\n\n\"Are you happy?\" This question was unexpected. Usually, I got a lecture at this point encouraging me to 'Lengthen my Stride' and 'Endure to the End'. How could I answer this question? It would hurt my parents to know that right now I was a scared little kid who just wanted to curl up in her bed and have Mom read her a bedtime story. They were expecting an almost adult and if I had ever been that, it had crumbled away before I could stop it.\n\n\"I'm really happy to be home,\" I said cautiously. \"I've been looking forward to Christmas with my family for a long time now.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\" Dad wasn't completely oblivious to the fact that I hadn't really answered his question, but he didn't act as if he was going to press it.\n\nWarmed by the cocoa and my parents' love, I continued on with a blissful run down of everything I wanted to do while I was here. Distraction was good. \"We have to go the see the lights at the temple. I really want to go caroling with the youth. Have they already done that? We are making Christmas cookies, right Mom? Do you think I can help with the Turkey this year? I need the practice. Do you have any wrapping left to do, I love helping with that?\"\n\nMom made a calming gesture with her hand and reached for her to do list. \"Christmas is only five days away, Megan, I am not sure we can get to everything. You missed the youth caroling on Wednesday. We saved the temple lights for tomorrow because we wanted you with us. George and Lindsey are meeting us there at 7:00. Christmas cookies are Monday and we are delivering them for Family Home Evening. Some of the Kelly's presents still need wrapping. The twins' presents are all wrapped because they peek. We are having the Missionaries over for dinner on Christmas Eve so we are doing the turkey then. Everything is on the calendar if you have any questions. That reminds me; Spencer's parents invited you to their New Year's Party. You should RSVP tomorrow if you are going to go.\"\n\nI made a mental note to decline the invitation; not being in much of a party mood. I owed Spencer a letter too, but not tonight. After finishing my cocoa, I washed the cup and went straight to bed. This way I could avoid further interrogation from Mom and Dad. It was about a half an hour later when I heard the sounds of everyone else turning in for the night. The bathroom door opening and closing several times as my siblings got ready for bed, was such a familiar sound and it made me feel safe.\nChapter 11\n\nThe next morning, I looked around my old room wondering how it had managed to get messy so quickly. My suitcase was on the floor next to my bed, its contents scattered about. To be fair, the mess wasn't entirely mine nor was the room anymore. Mom's sewing projects took up the majority of the space leaving me with just a mattress and box spring sitting on the floor and a small table with a lamp next to the bed. I was curious so I lifted the quilted tablecloth and was not at all surprised to find the table was stacked food storage.\n\nThere was something so comforting in knowing that even though my room was no longer mine, I could still predict my mom enough to know a silly little detail like there being food storage masquerading as a bedside table.\n\nSince my suitcase was disheveled anyway, I took the opportunity to dig out the presents for everyone that I'd brought home with me. Still in my pajamas, I carried them out to the tree. Kelly was right there with me as soon as she saw presents.\n\n\"Which one is mine?\"\n\n\"The one with the teddy bear wrapping.\"\n\n\"Oh, can I see? Am I going to like it? Can I shake it?\"\n\n\"Here, have at it. I'm going to take a shower.\" I tossed the small gift into her lap and she gave me the first smile of the new week. I kissed the top of her head as I left.\n\n* * *\n\nBy evening time, I'd relaxed a little. Much of my day had been me worrying about being alone with either of my parents. My emotions were still so jumbled and I didn't want to have to explain or worry them with tears. It helped that Mom was going to be teaching in Relief Society, so her mind was elsewhere.\n\nI sat in between the Drew and Kelly during Sacrament Meeting. Each of them scooted in so close that I almost didn't have room to move my arms. I remembered how my brothers and I had taken turns with Kelly in the hall when she was little. There were days we'd fought over who got to take her out. Now we were all sitting, practically grown up. I could feel the call for a more chaotic but simpler time. Back then, I had never worried if I was enough; had never felt so out of touch with my dreams.\n\n* * *\n\nDinner was simple, simple and a little tasteless. I was doing the cooking. No one complained as they ate the homemade chicken soup, but no one asked for seconds either. I was reminded of how delicious Andy's soup had been. These thoughts were not helpful or wanted. Moping would just be wasting the valuable time I had with my family. I pasted on a smile and distracted myself by doing the dishes.\n\nWhen dinner was all cleaned up, we drove to the Mesa, Arizona temple. The lights display was always one of my favorite parts of Christmas. Live music filled the air, as did the scent of the oranges that hung in the trees along the path. We were to meet George and Lindsey at the front of the visitors' center. I was anxious to see George and get a hug from my big brother.\n\nThey were there, just as we'd planned, but not quite as I'd pictured. Together they were bundled up in their heavy jackets against the balmy Arizona night. Their heads leaning together as they talked in whispers. They were so close, it was hard to tell where George stopped and Lindsey began. So much for the open arms of my big brother.\n\nI watched the two of them as we wondered around the grounds. They never let go of each other. It was as if super glue had been applied to their arms and hands. The more I watched, the harder it became to be around them. This was something I would never have. My failed relationship with Andy had finally driven home to me just what I had lost all those years ago.\n\nI felt myself getting grumpy and I looked up at the stars trying to keep my eyes from overflowing. When the family went to view a film in the visitors' center, I made an excuse and escaped. I was making my way past the nativity, when I felt a tap on my shoulder.\n\n\"What's wrong, Snapper?\" I knew instantly who it was without even looking. Dad had given me that nickname when I was very small because he said I swam like a fish. It had taken him days before he'd settled on which fish name he was going to use. We had gone through flounder, grouper, and marlin. The name had stuck for a few years, but it had been ages since he'd used it.\n\nI didn't answer right away. I just stared at the shepherd in the nearly life size scene. He had a lamb across his shoulders and he looked so peaceful. I missed feeling that calm and happy.\n\nDad didn't let me off. \"Come on, talk to me. I know something is going on with you.\"\n\nThis was so not the place I wanted to be having this conversation nor was it a conversation I was ready to have. Instead, I posed a question. \"Dad, what do you think that shepherd is thinking?\"\n\n\"Well, I've never really thought about it before. Let's see...\" He studied the figure for a moment. \"I think he's feeling joy and contentment. Don't you think the Savior would radiate those types of feelings, even as a baby?\"\n\n\"I guess.\"\n\n\"What do you think he is feeling?\"\n\n\"Restful, like some big burden has been lifted.\"\n\n\"That works too. The Savior can carry our burdens for us.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"Because of the atonement.\"\n\n\"Yes, but how do we give him our burdens?\"\n\n\"That can be tricky. Sincere prayer and pleading is probably the biggest part of it, but we also have to let go. It took me years to figure out how to give some things to Him. I liked being in control and doing it all myself.\"\n\nA new musical number began behind us and I turned my attention away from the shepherd. What Dad said hadn't been very helpful. Was that because I was like him, and insisted on doing things myself? That just made one more thing about me that wasn't right. Life was getting worse by the day, how would I make it to the New Year?\n\nWe ended the night with Mom's famous candy bar cake. It was so rich that most of us couldn't eat more than half a piece. I say most because it was George's favorite. He ate the rest of Lindsey's piece and asked for seconds. We sat around the tree and sang carols while Drew played piano for us. Matt built a fire in the fireplace that would probably last all night. Kelly fell asleep with her head in my lap. I loved the warmth of all the family together.\n\nI basked in the fuzzy warm memory without paying too much attention to any one thing. The more details I noticed the more my brain worked and my brain was not my best friend at the moment. This strategy worked for most of the night, until George and Lindsey got up to go home. They were so sickeningly cute about helping each other on with their coats. It wasn't even cold outside. I couldn't stand the way George checked Lindsey's zipper to make sure she wouldn't catch cold. I said a quick goodnight to them and walked Kelly to her bed.\n\n* * *\n\nThe inevitable conversation with Mom came, it just took a little longer than I'd expected. New Year's Eve morning while I was helping with the breakfast dishes, she said, \"I'm disappointed that you chose not to go the Waters' party. They are really missing Spencer and having you there would mean so much to them.\"\n\n\"I know. I'm just not really in a party mood.\"\n\n\"What is going on with you? You haven't been your usual perky self.\"\n\n\"Just thinking, I guess.\" She didn't buy it. The look of disbelief on her face was almost funny. I choked back a laugh.\n\n\"Megan, you can talk to me about anything. You know that, right? Are you feeling okay? Do you need to see a doctor?\" She paused to place a wet hand on my forehead.\n\n\"Mom, I'm not sick.\"\n\n\"Is it Andy?\"\n\nI sighed. I may as well come clean. \"Sort of, but not really. I mean it was at the start, but I can't help thinking, you know?\"\n\nNow she looked puzzled. She grabbed the towel from my hands and led me to her bedroom at the back of the long hallway. I'd had many talks with Mom lying across her bed. The familiar surroundings and the fact that we wouldn't be overheard or interrupted untied my tongue.\n\n\"I liked Andy. Things were going pretty well. Things were getting serious enough, at least, that I realized he needed to know about my surgery.\" I paused as a small oh, formed on Mom's lips.\n\n\"Didn't go so well?\"\n\n\"Well, he was nice about it, then he got all weird. After a few days, I couldn't take it anymore so we talked. And well you know the rest.\"\n\n\"Oh, honey. I am so sorry. But you can't get discouraged. He just wasn't the right one. You'll get someone better. Just be patient.\"\n\nI know that she was trying to comfort me, but the words seemed trite and completely unhelpful. \"Don't you see Mom? It doesn't matter. Anyone I love enough to marry, I would love enough not to doom them to my burden. It's over, there is no happy ending. The weird thing is that I never saw it coming. In all these years, I have never worried about the whole kid thing. In that one small conversation, it feels like my world crashed down around me. I don't know how to go on. Motherhood is not for me and I realize now neither is marriage.\" I sobbed into the bedspread.\n\n\"Wait, Megan. Slow down. You are getting carried away. There are all kinds of options for you. Surely, there are lots of wonderful guys out there who would love you and make a wonderful life with you regardless. You need to give people a chance. And there is adoption, remember. You can have everything you want. Just give it time and put it in the Lord's hands.\"\n\nI smiled at her for reassurance, but I knew she was wrong. Some people just weren't meant to 'have it all'. I didn't know how to describe what I felt when I pictured that green eyed boy. No one should have to give that up for me. I cried harder and she let me cry for a long time without saying anything. It felt hopeless like nothing would ever be okay again. I managed to stop... eventually.\n\nTired and feeling guilty that I couldn't give Mom the happy ending that she wanted for me, I stood. \"Mom, I'm going to go caught a nap. Maybe I will stop by the Waters' tonight for a little while.\" It was a small consolation, but it cheered Mom. She sent me on my way, telling me she would keep Kelly out of my room for a couple of hours.\n\nWhen I woke, everyone was gone. I walked through the empty house looking around all the rooms full of memories. I felt strange. When I looked in the family room, I remembered the roughhousing with George that had turned bloody. We were wrestling when I fell over the back of the couch and split my chin on the floor. I reached up to feel the faint scar. Why was I feeling so homesick? Being with my family had been nice, but school was calling to me. Which home was real? It didn't really feel like I belonged anywhere anymore.\n\nMy family put me on the plane the next day with the usual hugs and goodbye wishes. Then Dad leaned in and whispered, \"I'll be calling to check in on you next week.\" I sighed. Dad apparently was going to be keep regular tabs on me. Mom must have filled him in on our little talk. I hugged him again and wanted so much to give him reassurances, but they would be empty. Instead, I nodded my head and said goodbye.\n\n* * *\n\nThat first week back at school was hard. When I got Spencer's smile total for the week, I realized that I had failed to collect any. This was my first time in years of doing this that I had to write zero in my journal. I didn't really care as much as I expected myself to. Smiles were just not the highest priority at the moment.\n\nThe trouble was, that I couldn't really figure out what the priority was. My homesickness wasn't eased by being back at school. Was there anything that would soothe my troubled heart? I truly felt lost and unable to find my way. The impulses that I have always had to ease any feelings of sadness seemed useless against all the doubt in my life.\n\nLiving in close quarters with other people, when you are struggling just to stay afloat, has some real problems. Jackie was the worst because we shared a room. She was my audience for every sniffle and every sigh. She tried several times to talk to me about Andy because, as she put it, talking it out would help me deal with it. She didn't know what was really bothering me and I wasn't ready for the pity, so I didn't tell her. My initial reaction was to tell her to back off, but I managed to keep my words civil if still icy.\n\nKristen also seemed concerned by my glum mood, but she was so busy with life that, thankfully, her attempts were only halfhearted. Melissa tried to talk to me almost as much as Jackie, but I was able to turn the conversation easy enough and then escape. Over the next few weeks, avoiding people became a way of life.\n\nI spent as much time alone as I could. Ducking Jackie's and Melissa's attempts to talk consumed much of my time. I began 'studying' at the library because Jackie couldn't find me there. My books sat on the table unopened. Mostly, I was just getting really good at solitaire on my laptop. I could see my life stretching out long and lonely in front of me.\n\nSchool was not as much of a distraction from my pain, as I would have hoped. I just couldn't get into the swing of this new semester. Not even biology, a favorite subject from high school, could rouse my attention. I didn't understand this. It should have made sense that school would be more important. It was all I had now. Everything seemed dull and colorless. Perhaps, it was just the grey winter weather.\n\nChurch had gone from uncomfortable to nearly unbearable. At first, the whispers and avoiding Andy had taken so much of my attention. Now, everywhere I turned there was no place for me. I began to wonder where I fit in a church that believed so strongly in families. I was only going to church now because everyone else was. If I stopped, it would be very obvious and I didn't need any more attention. It seemed logical that Heavenly Father had turned away from me. My life was in ruins.\n\nMaybe I should go home, but what would that solve? Then I would be even more of a loser. I couldn't become more of a burden to my family.\n\nDad's calls were harder to ignore than my roommates. When I didn't answer, he texted me. Seriously, Dad never texted, so I knew I couldn't keep putting him off.\n\n\"Hi Dad,\"\n\n\"How are things going, Megan?\"\n\n\"About the same. How are you guys? Did Kelly have another recital yet?\"\n\n\"We can talk about Kelly some other time. I want to hear about you.\"\n\n\"Really Dad, I don't know what to tell you. School's going okay and work is work. In fact, I need to head off to class now. Love you, bye.\"\n\nI didn't want to hurt him, but I didn't want to talk to anyone. Nothing that anyone said could make it better so I just wanted to not talk about it and forget.\n\nMy Dad and roommates weren't the only one's checking up on me. Christy, one of my visiting teachers, called or came by at least once a week to see how things were going. I tried to be polite and cheerful when she did, but it was hard to put the brave face on for too long. It was nice that she was trying, but the last thing I needed was a visiting teacher digging for my secrets and then spreading them around the ward.\n\nMy uncharitable thoughts about her disappeared one day when she stopped me, as I was walking into my apartment. I invited her in, hoping that the place would be full of roommates she could talk to instead of me. To my dismay, we were all alone.\n\n\"Megan, I can't stop thinking about you.\"\n\n\"I'm okay, you don't need to worry.\"\n\n\"It's okay if you don't want to talk about it. I understand. I just want to tell you that I know Heavenly Father loves you.\"\n\n\"That's a nice thought. Thanks,\" I said, forcing a smile.\n\n\"Megan, I'm not telling you this because we have learned it in church since we were sunbeams.\" She paused trying to find the words that she wanted to say, \"I know He loves you because he keeps reminding me that He loves you.\"\n\nI looked up quickly at her and then back down in my lap, trying to avoid the tears in her eyes. \"Thanks, Christy,\" I said quietly. \"But I'm not getting the same message right now.\" How could she know that I was completely unlovable?\n\n\"Then you aren't listening to the right messenger.\" She stood and excused herself before I could argue. Tears were forming in my eyes, but she couldn't be right. I had the evidence concealed right here in my damaged body. I sat at the table and opened my biology book. I would not dwell on this. It was too painful.\n\n* * *\n\n\"Mark asked about you again,\" Kristen said when she got home from class. I was avoiding everyone at the moment, but especially my friends from D41. It was just too hard to fake enthusiasm and a smile. Mark was still trying to be my friend. I had no idea why. Surely, he knew the truth, if anyone did. I was not very friendly just now, but then Mark was just good like that. Maybe I reminded him of old Mr. Wallace; all prickles, but with a hidden soft spot. He'd have to dig pretty deep to find that soft spot now.\n\nThinking of Mr. Wallace, reminded me that I had made myself a promise. Unlovable I may be, but I didn't have to be useless. I could keep a promise, even to myself. Tomorrow, I would visit Mr. Wallace. Not that my visit would mean much to him, but promises are promises.\n\nThe next afternoon, I walked down into town from campus. It was mid-February and my bike was covered in snow. It was too icy for biking anyway. The sidewalks were pretty clear and there was no wind so the walk was pleasant enough. I reached the hospital, hoping that my unannounced visit would be okay. I wasn't sure what the procedures were. It took me a minute to wipe all the snow off my feet before I went to the reception counter.\n\n\"I would like to see Mr. Wallace please.\"\n\nThere was a slight hesitation by the woman behind the desk who was dressed in a business jacket. \"Are you family?\"\n\n\"No, I'm kind of a friend. I just wanted to say hi.\" It sounded lame coming out, but I had no other excuse.\n\n\"Okay, you can go on back to his room. Do you know the way?\"\n\n\"Yes. Thank you.\"\n\nI followed the hall around to the dining room. I could remember the path from there. I knocked on the open door and stepped inside. \"Mr. Wallace?\"\n\nHe was sitting on the edge of his bed completely dressed down to his shoes again. His hair, or what was left of it, was neatly combed. He was looking out the window again. This time, I could see that it was to an inner courtyard where some birds were playing. \"What?\" He looked up, \"Who are you?\"\n\nI searched for what to say. \"I'm Mark's friend, Megan. We met not too long ago.\"\n\n\"Marky's friend? Oh, okay. What do you want?\"\n\n\"I thought I would come and visit for a while.\"\n\n\"Well, it's still a free country. Sit down if you want.\" His head gestured to the chair and then his eyes went back to the window.\n\nI sat and then looked out the window too. \"I'm surprised that there are still birds here. It is pretty cold outside.\"\n\n\"Really, I wouldn't know.\" He said sourly. His face was always drawn down in a twisted frown and I knew enough now not to take it personally.\n\n\"I guess it gets kind of boring in here. Do you get many visitors?\"\n\nDespite its seeming impossibility, his frown deepened. \"So, what? You came here to depress me kid? Thanks, but I've got all I can use. Why don't you go?\"\n\nI sat a moment longer trying to retrieve the situation. Seeing a black and white picture on the wall, I commented, \"Is that your wife?\" The picture was of a tall man and a small woman with curly, dark hair. They were arm in arm and smiling. It was strange to see this young Mr. Wallace smiling.\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"She's pretty.\"\n\n\"She's dead and I don't need chit chat or pity. Weren't you leaving?\"\n\nI gave up and left the room feeling like a failure. Well, at least I had tried. But could one grump cheer another?\n\n\"Megan?\" a voice called, as I walked slowly down the hallway.\n\nI turned to see Mark. I had forgotten that it was his day to work. Great, I wasn't in the mood for chit chat either, at least not with someone who knew me. \"Oh, hi,\" I said with little enthusiasm.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"I came to visit Mr. Wallace. It was a bad idea. I think I made him upset.\"\n\n\"Mr. Wallace? Well, I'll check on him, but he's always that way. Don't worry.\" He searched my face. \"It was nice of you to come. He never gets visitors.\"\n\nI can see why, I thought, but said \"No problem.\"\n\n\"I would give you a ride home, but I have to work for another two hours. Will you be okay?\"\n\n\"It's nice out today. I don't mind the walk.\" I waved before he could get any closer and left.\n\nI replayed the conversation with Mr. Wallace in my head the whole way home looking for any way that it could have turned out better. There was just no way of knowing if different topics would have helped. I hardly knew the man. Then I corrected the thought, I didn't know the man. At that moment, a thought occurred to me. I might not know him, but I could understand him. Wasn't I doing the same thing to everyone in my life? Laughing, I thought about how much I had in common with that prickly, old man. My future was staring me in the face and it was lonely.\n\nThe thought should have frightened me, but instead I felt a strange triumph. This was part of the reason for my pain and I was justified in feeling it. Pushing everyone away was a normal reaction. I wasn't broken, in that, at least. My mind circled around the possibilities for a future without the complications of relationships. In time, might I rid myself of all of them and not have to feel the pain of others' pity and worry?\n\nI remembered the sight of Mr. Wallace crying and Mark next to him holding his hand. Marky, he called him. Even Mr. Wallace had a friend. I thought of the picture of Mr. Wallace smiling with his arms around his wife. It felt like a betrayal in a way, he'd had a family and I never would.\n\nPain seared new in my chest. Tears filled my eyes and I hurt all over. Just putting one foot in front of the other, I walked through the streets heading in the general direction of my apartment. I felt more alone than ever. Before I'd gotten too far the wind began to blow. It seemed to blow right through me as if I wasn't there.\n\nI cried myself to sleep that night, but quietly so as I could so that I wouldn't wake up Jackie. In the morning, my head hurt. Lying in bed for a time, I tried to find the will to get up. The light of the sun shone in the window and landed on my face. Blinking, I realized that I had overslept. I was late to work. I jumped up, wincing at the pain in my head, dressed, and ran out the door. My daily tasks were the only things I could still do. Those tasks were all that I had managed to keep in this shattered life of mine. Now in my despair, I had ruined even that.\n\nI sighed, half running to work through the ice and snow. Despair was a useless emotion. I seemed to get nowhere dwelling on my pain. Life just kept getting worse and worse. I was done with it; done with the sideways looks from my roommates, done with the whispered conversations that stopped when I entered the room, done with being useless, just done with all the pain.\n\nOkay, so I wasn't going to get everything I wanted. It was time to focus on what I did have or I would lose everything. It was time to go on. I pushed all the hurt feelings down deep where I could keep them in check. Today, I would move on with whatever part of my life was left.\n\nWork and school would be my focus now. That is how I would go on. It is all I had. Busying myself to get all the things at work done despite my hour late start, I had a few moments peace in my head. I was always a good worker and now I would be even better. School could use a lot more attention too. If I just crowded the pain out, maybe I would find the joy of school again. I was going to delete solitaire from my computer and never hide again. No more mindless distractions for me. I was simply going to change focus. We were part way through the winter semester and I was halfheartedly working on my class assignments. It wouldn't be hard at all to do better.\n\nPlans were fine, but actions were another story. I went through the day tentatively as if I had sore muscles; testing each step to determine if it hurt more. It was strange how noisy everything seemed, as if I hadn't heard all the confusion around me for a month and a half. Had it only been that long? It seemed so much longer. I certainly felt older.\n\nAs I was getting home that afternoon, I saw Christy again. I returned her wave and tried to add a smile. \"God loves me,\" she'd said. I knew that at one time he did. Maybe eventually, I could work my way back to his favor.\nChapter 12\n\nThe next morning I awoke on time. At work, I completed everything early and looked for extra things to do. One of the full time staff had me inventory in the large room that held canned goods. The paperwork reminded me of the management class I was taking this semester. It got me thinking about my career.\n\nThe longer I was in the recreation program, the more I knew that I wanted to have my own summer camp. I loved being out in nature and I'd always wanted to give others that experience. A life of service in this way might allow me to still see others smile without having to get too close.\n\nThe future had always been something to plan for, but not to dwell on. I had always lived in the moment. Now more than ever, I needed a dream; something to focus on and work towards. I would make this camp my focus.\n\nMy goal needed a plan. I set to work making one. First, I would get more information and for that I needed input. I decided to play roving reporter.\n\n\"What was your favorite part of summer camp?\" I asked everyone: people waiting to enter a classroom, the person behind the counter in the store, and even random people I stopped between classes. It was odd, at first I thought talking with people again would be difficult and truly, the first time it was. Some of the awkwardness eased when I realized that no one was looking at me with pity. Strangers were easier to talk to than friends.\n\nWhen Dad called, I was able to reassure him that things were going better. \"Really Dad, I am excited about this summer camp idea. If I can get it all researched and planned right, I could really pull it off.\"\n\n\"Great, Megan. You would be really good at that. We would get free rates right?\" he said with an obvious smile in his voice. That was nice. Usually in these talks he just sounded serious and worried. My smile totals were still abysmally low. At least this week, I would have one.\n\nThe serious tone came back. \"How are your prayers going?\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said weakly, not really wanting to discuss it. I had gotten out of the habit.\n\n\"Here is my fatherly council to you, then... pray harder.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Dad,\" I said, trying now to figure out how to get him off the phone. \"I've got to go. I love you.\"\n\nHe didn't return the goodbye, but instead said, \"It really works, Megan. You just have to keep at it.\"\n\n\"Bye.\"\n\nHe gave me a reluctant goodbye and I hung up.\n\nShaking off the phone call, I returned my attentions to my business plans. The responses were varied when I talked to people. Some answers were categorically unhelpful. Others had never been to summer camp or even scout or girls camp. Every once in a while, though, I got an answer that I could use.\n\nWater activities seemed to be especially popular ranging from swimming and canoeing to white water. Campfire times also seemed to be remembered fondly. Those had always been my favorite, too. I kept track of the answers knowing that my camp would have to start out kind of small and I needed to prioritize.\n\nAt first, location seemed to be an easy thing to plan, but it turned out to be was much more involved than I had anticipated. There were zoning laws, building restrictions, utility accessibility, and taxes. At least, while I was still in school, I had the resource of knowledgeable professors to help. If I had tried to do this without all the research and preparation, I would have given up in frustration one week into it. So I kept plugging in the numbers and the results of my surveys. I had spread sheets on my computer for financing, survey results and even a timeline. They were constantly being updated. Without a social life, I found there was all kinds of time for planning.\n\nThe next item on my survey list was accommodations. I asked people if they preferred cabins or tents. Then, I wanted to know what kind of bathroom facilities they felt worked best. Of course, flush toilet won hands down, but I was surprised to learn that most surveyed didn't want mirrors, just a small sink. For most people, showers were optional if there was swimming. The cabins and tents debate was pretty evenly split. It wasn't unusual for a camp to have both; maybe that was a solution.\n\nCamp food can be handled in a couple of ways, too. Most people seemed to like the experience of cooking on a campfire themselves, but many complained about lack of variety. I typically sampled 200 people for each question. Then I would plug my numbers in and watch my records grow.\n\nIt was funny how some people once they got talking about their camp experiences, they couldn't stop. I understood that enthusiasm. My enthusiasm was growing as well just from listening to their experiences and remembering my own. My smile totals were also growing again. People seemed to light up as they remembered.\n\n\"I went to this camp one year that had a cable strung between two trees and you slid down the cable on a zip line. I stood in line over and over all day just to ride it,\" one person confided.\n\n\"I went on this hike once where I had to cross a fallen log bridge in the rain. I was so sure I was going to slip off,\" another had said.\n\n\"We always TP'd the neighboring camp on our last night.\" I laughed at this one, remembering a girl's camp experience of my own.\n\n\"I liked to go out and sit on a rock all by myself and just listen to the sounds of the woods.\" This, too, I could empathize with, nature was one of my favorite chapels.\n\n\"The best place to see the stars was from the middle of the lake so we would go out on these barges and stargaze.\" This memory, of a girl from California, had made me want to be there too. I could just picture it in my mind.\n\nLife was better, but I still hadn't faced D41 yet. The pain was there, it was just muted; taken over by distractions. I was still avoiding Jackie, too. She was the most persistent of my roommates. The others had given up a couple of weeks ago when their repeated attempts to befriend me had been in vain.\n\nI knew I wasn't fixed yet. I was still angry with Heavenly Father for my broken body and for the loneliness it produced. My surveys had proven to me that I was na\u00efve to think I could avoid people. It was clear that I was going to have to open up my heart again to clean out some of this mess. But this idea was frightening. How could I be sure I could go on again if it didn't work?\n\n* * *\n\nChristy's words had slowly been working in the back of my mind for a couple of weeks, since my visit with Mr. Wallace. The question on my mind was \"How do I listen to the right messenger?\" I fell back on all those lessons I'd had over the years. I began with my scriptures and then slowly added in my prayers.\n\nAt first, it was hard. I didn't want to be comforted. Life wasn't fair and I should get to feel as sad about it as I wanted. Faking being happy for everyone else wasn't really fooling anyone so why bother. Then, I realized that I didn't really like myself anymore. I wanted to be better and feel happy again.\n\n* * *\n\nThat very week, while I was sitting in the living room writing Spencer for the first time since Christmas, the apartment phone rang. I was very surprised that it was Nathan. If he had called my cell, I wouldn't have answered. But I always answered the apartment phone in case it was for one of my roommates.\n\n\"Hey, Megan, glad I got a hold of you,\" he said all excited.\n\n\"What's up Nathan?\" It really was good to hear his voice.\n\n\"I got my mission call today!\"\n\n\"Wow, where are you going?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you when you come for the party tonight, 6 o'clock, okay?\"\n\nYikes, I wasn't quite ready to sit casually at a party, especially not there. Things were still weird. \"Gee...\" before I could go on, Nathan broken in.\n\nSensing my hesitation, he continued, \"Andy won't be here, he has to work. You have to come. We miss you.\"\n\n\"Okay, Nathan, I'll be there.\" The response that used to be automatic had taken some effort this time, but I was going to face this. It made me smile to think that they might miss me; maybe I wasn't that unlovable. Plus, I really wanted to know where Nathan was going.\n\nI walked down to the bookstore and bought some chips to take to the party. I didn't want to go empty handed. I made it back home with plenty of time to spare. It was only 5:00 and I sat fidgeting. It was tempting to go early, just because having made the decision to try, I hated waiting in limbo. Andy would have left for work by now; did they need help getting ready?\n\nIt had been a long time since I had just hung out with them. I was surprised when I realized that I really missed them and not just them, but Jackie, Kristen and Melissa too. I wanted my friends back. If only I could be a friend worth having again.\n\n* * *\n\nIt was hard, but I waited until 6 o'clock like instructed and then knocked on the door. Nathan answered it, beaming from ear to ear. I waited to see if his smile would fade when he saw it was me, but it didn't. He welcomed me inside. The room was still pretty empty, but Emily and John were sitting together on the couch. It was then that I saw the large banner on the wall above them. The curly cue letters and the bright rainbow colors, had me convinced that Emily had made the sign. \"Korea?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yeah, can you believe it?\"\n\n\"Well, congratulations! When do you report?\"\n\n\"First week in May.\"\n\n\"I'm so happy for you, Nathan.\" He reached for a hug and I awkwardly complied.\n\nI moved on to say hi to John and Emily when someone else knocked. \"How are you guys doing?\" I asked sitting next to Emily.\n\n\"We're a little freaked out, actually. We have to move the wedding date up if Nathan is going to get to attend. So many things to do...\" she trailed off distracted.\n\n\"Oh, wow! Congratulations I didn't know you guys were engaged.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" John said, smiling and looking rather pleased with himself.\n\nMore people sat and began to talk. Things were in full party mode and I was feeling a little overwhelmed. A party was not the best place to reintroduce myself to social things.\n\nMark came out of his room just as I was thinking about leaving. He walked over to me. This was going to be hard. I braced myself for the sound of pity in his voice.\n\n\"Megan, it is so good to see you. Someone I know can't stop talking about you.\" His genuine smile was a welcome sight. That made two already this evening, maybe they really did miss me. However, his words worried me. I hoped he wasn't talking about Andy.\n\nHe gestured toward the table where the food was laid out. I grabbed a handful of chips and a cookie. We stood in the kitchen because the living room was filling up with well-wishers.\n\n\"I'm afraid to ask?\" I finally said, blowing out a huff of air.\n\n\"Mr. Wallace is smitten, I think. He said to tell you to come back and visit.\"\n\n\"What? He practically kicked me out.\" I was surprised, but pleased.\n\n\"I guess your charms are growing on him.\" He wiggled his eyebrows at me and I laughed. I actually laughed. It felt strange.\n\n\"I need to make another visit then. Maybe I can do it next week.\" I said, mentally checking my calendar. I needed to take something to entertain the man, too. I wondered if he liked games.\n\n\"Let me know, I'll go with you,\" Mark said, shoving a handful of chips into his mouth.\n\n\"So how are the Cole's doing?\" I was feeling more relaxed and it felt nice for a change.\n\n\"Everyone at home is great. Micah has even come off of the oxygen. I think Rebekah is a little mad at me, though.\"\n\n\"Why, what did you do?\" I asked, surprised.\n\n\"Well, after her last call to you, I told her not to call you anymore.\"\n\n\"What! Why would you do that?\" I was shocked, but at least she hadn't called while I was really out of it. She was one friend I hadn't managed to push away.\n\n\"I figured you wanted some space, I mean, you stopped coming here. And you've been so.... sad.\" He looked at me, searching my face.\n\n\"I guess, I get it, but really it was unnecessary.\"\n\n\"So are you feeling better?\"\n\n\"I'm getting there.\"\n\n\"So when do you want to go and see Mr. Wallace?\"\n\n\"I'll go see him sometime this week after school. You don't need to take me.\"\n\n\"Okay, and how about a ride to church tomorrow? It's supposed to be raining.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said, excusing myself before I could make any more promises. I went back to the food table for a drink. It had been a long time since I had tried to be normal and I wasn't sure how long I could keep it up. When my cup was empty, I tossed it in the trash can, said my goodbyes, and left early.\n\n* * *\n\nThe next morning when Mark knocked on the door, Jackie and I followed him out to the parking lot. It was a little less squished with Jackie than it had been with Andy. The thought made me sad and I tried to shake off the discomfort.\n\n\"Mark, I have been meaning to ask you... What was your favorite part of summer camp?\"\n\nHe looked at me puzzled. Jackie broke in, \"Oh, she asks everyone that question. She is a bit obsessed with her business plan.\"\n\n\"I never really went to a summer camp. Is scout camp okay?\"\n\n\"Sure, any group camping experience works.\"\n\n\"I guess, I liked the music the most. You know, all the campfire songs and the stories. Hiking was really fun, too. Do I have to have just one favorite?\"\n\nI smiled because there was a little gleam in Mark's eye that I had seen a lot during my survey. \"No, tell me all the stuff you liked. We have time.\"\n\n\"There was this one trail at scout camp that led to a hot spring. We usually ran it, being kids, you know. But one day I was walking there by myself because I had finished my cleaning assignment early. I rounded a corner and I saw an eagle perched just off the trail. I was quiet and kept my distance. He didn't even fly away. It was amazing.\"\n\n\"Cool,\" I breathed. We rode in silence for a moment, enjoying the picture that his words had painted. Funny how little things like that can make you feel the Spirit. It had been while since I'd felt that good. To keep tears from coming, I went on.\n\n\"Okay, if you have your choice, which is better cabin or tent?\"\n\n\"Is it winter or summer?\"\n\n\"Summer.\"\n\n\"Definitely tent. It feels more like you are camping when you are in a tent.\"\n\n\"Have you ever been in one of those old army canvas tents? The smell just enhances that feeling for me.\" My nose wrinkled in memory.\n\n\"One camp we went to had those. I didn't like them because they were so dark in the daytime.\"\n\nArriving at church, Mark stepped ahead and opened the building door for us. We felt a rush of warm air and hurried inside before we got soaked.\n\n\"Any more questions?\"\n\n\"Two. What kind of bathroom facilities make camping the best? And do you prefer cafeteria type dining or cooking your own food in camp?\" We headed for the stairs that would take us to the next level.\n\n\"Are you serious? Please tell me no one has chosen pit toilets over flush.\" His vote was obvious.\n\n\"Well, it doesn't hurt to ask,\" I said. But he was right; not one person in the survey had chosen pit toilets.\n\n\"I think I like cooking my own food, just not for breakfast. I don't want to have to get up for that.\" He smiled and winked as he spoke. I'd forgotten he was not a morning person. I counted his smile as the first for my week. Sometimes, I thought I should thank people for their smiles. This was one of those times because his smile made me feel happy.\n\n\"Thanks, you gave me some good thoughts.\" We entered the room where we held Sacrament Meeting. Andy waved to Mark. He had saved him a seat. His eyebrows went up when he saw me and I quickly turned away. \"Go, ahead. Jackie and I have each other to sit by and we had better save seats for the rest.\"\n\nMark reluctantly left, probably feeling guilty that he was choosing one friend over another. But I knew it was no contest, best friends win every time. This was not supposed to work out like this. I should never have dated anyone from D41, or anyone at all, a small voice in my head said. Then, I would still have my friends and my comfortable, ignorant dreams. Quickly, I pushed the thoughts away, before they could take hold, and said a prayer for help.\n\nThe rest of our roommates made it just before the opening song. Sliding into the seats that Jackie and I had saved, Kristen and Melissa waved at me. Did they really still care after all I had done to push them away? It was amazing that I still had good friends in my roommates; a bonus I was not expecting.\n\nChurch was less uncomfortable this time. Everywhere I turned, I saw smiles. They weren't necessarily for me, but somehow it still felt friendly. My world was starting to color again and it was happening so slowly that I felt like I was watching a movie.\n\n* * *\n\nThat night Mom called. She gave me the usual rundown of what the twins were doing and how Kelly was keeping her busy. It was nice to hear some news from home, now that I felt human enough to care. She hesitated for a moment then said, \"I have other news too. George and Lindsey are going to have a baby. Can you believe it?\"\n\nIt felt like I had been hit in the stomach, but I put my brave face on. \"Wow, I guess that makes you a grandma. Congratulations. Tell George and Lindsey I'm happy for them.\"\n\n\"It makes you an aunt, so congratulations to you too.\"\n\n\"Hey, yeah. I didn't think of it that way. Well, I have things to get done before tomorrow. Love you.\"\n\nI hung the phone up, went to bed and cried myself to sleep again. Jackie had to be used to it by now, so I didn't worry about disturbing her. Was it always going to be this hard?\n\n* * *\n\nI just got up the next morning, said my prayers and went on. It was all I could do, though with every step forward it seemed like I was being pushed back. There were so many emotions in my life that I didn't want. It was all just too overwhelming to deal with.\n\nThe busy week served as a good distraction and I started to feel a bit better. There were a few days of nice weather which had everyone hoping for spring. I was even able to start riding my bike to campus.\n\nThursday after class, I headed down to see Mr. Wallace. I was not sure what kind of reception I would get, but I wanted to try. This time, I knew that Mark would be working so maybe he could help me out if things went badly.\n\nMr. Wallace was lying in bed when I knocked. I wondered if he was feeling unwell. I hoped my visiting was okay. When I entered, he almost smiled and I could feel my eyebrows rising in response.\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Wallace. Are you sick?\"\n\n\"Of course I'm sick. Would any well person live here?\" He asked waving his arm around to indicate the whole building.\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear you aren't feeling well. Do you want me to go?\"\n\n\"No, I'm bored.\"\n\n\"Well, what would you like to do?\"\n\n\"Fly. Can you help me with that?\"\n\n\"Sorry, I'm fresh out of wings, but I brought the paper maybe I can read to you for a while.\"\n\nHe sat up in his bed a bit more and nodded his head so that I would begin. I started to read the headline news. It was all about some political scandal. He stopped me before I reached the third sentence. The next article on an earthquake in South America received the same rejection. I turned the page and tried again. He looked at me in disgust over artificial heart valves, street construction notices and even the movie reviews. Finally, in desperation, I started reading the personals.\n\n\"Now we're talking.\" He slapped his hands together and rubbed them back and forth, as if he were a villain in a melodrama.\n\nHe listened attentively, but often broke in with comments. I tried not to laugh at his interpretations of the buzz phrases and words people used to describe themselves. When I had gone through the two columns, he pronounced that once again there wasn't anyone good enough. This was more than I could take. I began to giggle and he glowered at me.\n\n\"I didn't know you were looking for love, Mr. Wallace?\"\n\n\"It's not for me. I'm looking for Marky. The boy should settle down. He spends too much time here.\"\n\n\"But that's his job,\" I objected mildly.\n\n\"Boy still needs a life. What's up with you and him anyway?\"\n\n\"We're friends.\" Mr. Wallace match making was just funny.\n\n\"Bah, friends. Time's too short! You kids just don't get that.\" I was surprised to hear him say that. Surely, the time dragged for him shut up in this room. \"I'm tired now, go home.\"\n\nI left the room with mixed emotions. My visit had lasted longer than the last time, but I still didn't think he liked me much. Poor guy was too grumpy for his own good. I would just have to keep trying, but a genuine smile from Mr. Wallace seemed nowhere in my future.\n\nI wondered what Mark would think of Mr. Wallace matchmaking for him. It could be funny to tell him but the conversation could turn on me fast. The last thing I wanted to discuss was my love life, even if teasing Mark about his would be fun.\nChapter 13\n\nMarch was a long month. Towards the end, we got lots of snow and I was back to walking to campus, which was a bit difficult when the sidewalks weren't always cleared. Campus walkways were never a problem, but my shoes were usually wet by the time I got there. After Nathan's party, I had begun to attend family home evening again. Nathan and Mark had started going with me because Andy was bringing the girl he was dating to their group. I thought their show of solidarity was a bit overkill, but was happy to have their company.\n\nOne family home evening we were told to dress warmly and bring gloves. I suspected a snowball fight. It wasn't supposed to be a snowball fight, we were making a fort, but a few projectiles made it into the air anyway.\n\nAfter I took a snowball to the side of the head, I had to retaliate. Nathan never saw it coming. I jumped on his back and he went face first into the snow. In a lightning fast motion, I was on my back and a pile of snow was being dumped onto my face. Wiggling away, I took refuge behind Mark who stood snowball at the ready watching Nathan closely. It felt good to be silly and have fun. I was starting to feel more like me all the time.\n\nAfter the snow, we all went back to our apartment for some hot cocoa. Nathan and Mark sat next to me at the table while we sipped, not wanting to burn our tongues. \"So, how is the mission prep going?\" I asked, making conversation.\n\n\"Pretty good, I just need to get my suits.\"\n\n\"Oh, that reminds me, wait here.\" I ran back to my room and found the package that had been waiting for me to remember it. \"I shouldn't give you this after that snow incident.\" I said, smiling and tossing him the box.\n\n\"Hey, you deserved it. I think my nose will be running for a week, thanks to you!\"\n\n\"You started it!\" I teased, sticking my tongue out at him.\n\nMark straightened his shoulders and put on a big daddy voice, \"Now kids, settle down.\" We all laughed. It felt so good to laugh.\n\n\"Well, you still owe me,\" Nathan said, faking hurt in his voice.\n\nI eyed the gift in his hands pointedly and said, \"Oh, how do you figure that?\"\n\nRemembering the present, he unwrapped the red striped tie and held it up to his chest. \"Thanks, Megan. It's cool. But I figure you owe me because you just disappeared. With the whole John and Emily thing, I could really have used a friend.\" Ouch!\n\n\"You looked like you were doing all right at your party.\"\n\n\"Those people were just there because of my call. But you hang out with me just because. I spent lots of nights as the third wheel with Emily and John. They're kind of driving me nuts.\"\n\n\"Sorry, things have just been...\" I trailed off not wanting to describe the pain. I'd managed to hurt so many people who cared about me. There were a lot of things I needed to fix. I said a silent prayer for help.\n\n\"Come on, you know Andy's work schedule and he is always gone now because of Savanna anyway. Come over.\"\n\n\"I will try to come over more often. I promise.\" This seemed to please both Nathan and Mark. \"I've missed you guys, too.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Nathan said. He looked at Mark and it seemed like they exchanged a signal. Mark got up and took our mugs into the kitchen. \"Megan, I was hoping you would go out with me on Friday. There is a dance; I thought it would be fun.\"\n\nI wasn't healed yet and this felt like a set up. \"You mean like a date?\" He nodded and for a moment, I considered it. What harm could it do? He was leaving on his mission soon and Nathan was always fun. Stopping myself before I could get too far, I shook my head, \"Sorry, Nathan, I actually don't date anymore. But I really appreciate the offer.\"\n\nI was just trying to be nice with that last part. I didn't appreciate the offer, or the reminder that I was too damaged to consider it. Maybe living in this love sick community was a bad idea.\n\nHe blinked, \"What, why don't you date anymore? That's crazy. Is this still about Andy? Come on Megan, that was months ago. You should move on.\"\n\n\"It's not Andy. I just... well it's kind of a long story, but thank you anyway.\" That last part was harder to add this time. I needed to get out of there, but this was my apartment not theirs.\n\nFeeling awkward and upset, I sat frozen. Thankfully, Mark, who had heard the whole exchange in the kitchen, returned and led Nathan back to their apartment before Nathan could argue anymore.\n\nI went back to my room and climbed into my bed. At least, I could still have fun with my friends, just no more dates. My mind continued the thought, no more holding hands, no more kisses, and no more feeling extra special to just one person. I sniffed and wondered if this would ever get any easier.\n\nI pulled out my scriptures for the first time in a long time. Maybe I could find solace there. I was just starting to read when I heard loud cheering and squealing sounds from the living room. Jackie burst in the door, \"Megan, guess what? Kristen and Tony are engaged.\" I managed a weak smile, she hardly noticed before she bounced back down the hall. Tomorrow was soon enough to congratulate Kristen. I didn't think I could do it tonight. I picked my scriptures back up and tried to read. My prayer that night was a simple plea, \"Heavenly Father, I can't do it anymore, please help me.\"\n\n* * *\n\nThe next day, I woke up feeling a little better. Getting out of bed seemed easier. During my Church History class, we were talking about answers to prayer. I started to look for those answers in my life. There were times when I had found something that was lost. There was the time that I prayed for a friend who was sick and they had gotten better. I used to trust prayer so much. How long it had been since I had gotten an answer to my prayers?\n\nWas Heavenly Father still listening? I thought of Christy and her constant watch over me when I was really lost. Then, I remembered the prayers that I had offered to learn to appreciate visiting teaching. Yes, she was an answer to that prayer. She had said the things that had helped me start to change. She reminded me that Heavenly Father did love me and he cared what I was doing and feeling.\n\nSo visiting teachers can bring messages from God and watch over His children even when they were lost. I had no idea until that moment how important they were or how lost I was. I said a prayer, thanking Heavenly Father for Christy and for loving me even when I was mad at Him.\n\nOn the way home, I bought a big Gerber daisy for Christy. I wrote a little note on a card thanking her for being the Lord's messenger. I hurried home and left it with her roommate. Then, I went home to get started on dinner. I would begin making things up to my roommates tonight.\n\nWhile dinner was cooking, I wrote an encouraging note to Spencer. His total for the week had been abysmal. I wondered how bad his week would have had to be to get only two smiles. Spencer was not the kind to wallow like I'd been doing. Thinking of him sent a flood of memories to my mind; Spencer pushing me into the pool, Spencer stealing a lick of my ice cream cone while I was distracted by driving. I sent him the smile that was on my face by drawing it on the bottom of his letter. At least, he could add my smile into next week's total.\n\nThe more I pondered, the more I could see all the answers to prayer in my life. Prayer was becoming important to me again, but in a different way. Where before it had been a nice way to communicate with Heavenly Father, now it was more like a life line. The peace that it brought reminded me of the peace I felt when I was in a forest. Craving that feeling, I knelt often and tried hard to listen. It was clear that not all of my answers would come in a day, but I was beginning to hope. I was done shutting Heavenly Father out of my life and that calmed my spirit more than anything else did.\n\n* * *\n\nI was trying my best to ignore my roommates one Friday night when my phone rang.\n\n\"Hey, Megan. I need to talk to you, can I come over?\" Mark asked.\n\n\"Things are kind of crazy here,\" I said, looking around at the wedding magazines spread out on the floor and couches. Giggling girls filled the living room. \"How about if I come over there?\"\n\nThere was a hesitation, \"Andy's here.\"\n\n\"That's okay. I'll be over in a few minutes.\" I put the phone down feeling proud of myself. It was time to stop avoiding him. It wasn't as if things were his fault anyway. I could be a grown up about this.\n\nI grabbed my jacket and put my shoes on. It wasn't quite barefoot weather yet, although April was more pleasant than the snowy March we'd had.\n\nThe walk to D41 was familiar again. I had started hanging out with the guys, but it was always when Andy was gone. Nathan had been a little weird about the whole date thing at first, but he got over it after a few visits. Always the competitor, he beat me at a game of Sorry one night and decided that things were back to normal. I even suggested that he take Jackie to out and he took my suggestion. According to Jackie, they'd had a lot of fun.\n\nI knocked and the door immediately swung open. Mark was looking down the hall as if he expected someone. He sighed, waved me in and closed the door. I guessed he was hoping that Andy would stay in their room. I suddenly wondered how the conversation had gone when he hung up with me. Did he tell Andy to stay out of the way? Did he tell him why?\n\nWe sat at the table and he fidgeted.\n\n\"What's up? Is everything good with your family?\"\n\n\"Great actually, that is kind of why I wanted to talk to you? Hear me out. This is going to seem like a strange request.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'm listening.\"\n\n\"My parents have decided that the family needs to take a vacation.\"\n\n\"That's great, where are you going?\"\n\n\"California. Mom wants us to see her favorite places from when she was little. She grew up there, you know. Anyway, the thing is... this will involve some camping and we aren't so sure how to make that happen.\" He paused and looked towards the hall again. \"I told my parents that you might be able to help us.\" He raised his brows, biting his lip.\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" I stared at him puzzled. The idea of helping the Coles had me immediately wanted to say yes, but out of habit, I approached with caution.\n\n\"Well, I was hoping that you could come home with me after school and stay with my family. The kids will have another month of school. That should be enough time to get everything planned and squared away for this monster vacation. After the trip, I could drop you off at home in Arizona.\"\n\nIt was a strange request, but I liked it. The experience would certainly be good and I wasn't really looking forward to another long summer at home; especially watching Lindsey's tummy expand. \"It sounds fun, but I kind of need to work over the summer to afford my tuition for next year.\"\n\n\"I thought of that. My mom says she can get you a job teaching swim lessons at the local pool. That's what you did before, right?\"\n\n\"So you want me to go to Idaho with you, live with your family and prepare them for a big camping vacation to California?\"\n\n\"That's pretty much it. You could put it on your resume or something. We could really use your help. We are way out of our depth here. You know we never go anywhere.\"\n\n\"It sounds totally fun and I would love to check out Idaho. I'd never really been there before. I have to check with my family first. Can I let you know?\"\n\n\"Sure. That's great! I have some ideas about the trip, too. Let me know when you can.\" He was acting so jittery, I had to laugh.\n\n\"I'll go home and call them right now.\" I stood up and headed for the door.\n\n\"Oh, do you want my home phone number so your parents can call mine?\"\n\n\"No, I don't think that will be necessary. Besides, I already have Rebekah's number.\"\n\n\"Why don't we meet somewhere later and you can tell me what they said.\"\n\n\"I have to do my laundry. Can you meet me in the laundry room in about an hour?\"\n\n* * *\n\nI walked home with all kinds of ideas running through my head. The parks in California were so beautiful. I was getting excited about this adventure before I even got the okay. Bursting through the door, I headed for my phone.\n\nMom answered right away. She was in the kitchen loading the dishwasher. I told her all about it. She wasn't enthusiastic about the idea. \"Well, let me get Dad and we can all talk about it.\"\n\nDad's first reaction was to laugh, \"Megan, you are an adult. Why are you asking us?\"\n\n\"I just wanted to know if you thought it would be okay if I don't come home for a while.\"\n\n\"Well, we would miss you, but it sounds like a good opportunity.\"\n\nMom jumped in at this point, \"How much do you know about this family? What if they aren't nice to you?\"\n\n\"Mom, they aren't like that. Mark and Rebekah are great. I am sure I will be fine.\"\n\n\"Megan, are you happy about this?\" It was Dad again. He was really interested in my happiness lately.\n\n\"Yeah!\" I beamed into the phone.\n\n\"Then go for it,\" Dad offered.\n\n\"But...\" Mom started to say.\n\n\"Love you guys! I'll go tell them now.\"\n\nI hung up the phone and called Rebekah.\n\n\"Hello, Rebekah? So, would you mind having a roommate for a while?\"\n\n\"Who is this?? Megan?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\nI guessed her response was no because all I could hear was loud, excited screaming. \"You're really coming?\"\n\n\"Yes, I just decided.\" It felt strange to say that. I had decided, not my parents.\n\n\"Oh, we are going to have so much fun!\"\n\n\"Listen, Rebekah, I need to go tell Mark now. Talk to you later?\"\n\n\"Sure, I'll tell everyone here.\"\n\n\"I think they probably already know thanks to your screaming.\"\n\n\"No, I do that all the time,\" she laughed. \"Bye!\"\n\nI put the phone down and gathered my laundry. The load was really big. As I struggled down the hall and out the front door with it, I promised myself again that I would do it sooner next time.\n\n* * *\n\nI was putting my laundry in the dryers when Mark walked in carrying a basket. \"This was a good idea,\" he said, heading for the washer. \"It got me in here to take care of this before I ran out of clothes. I hate laundry.\"\n\n\"I know what you mean. I had three loads this time because I waited so long.\"\n\n\"Well, what did your folks say?\" He seemed anxious and I was happy that I could give him good news. Mark would do anything for his family. I was pretty sure delivering me as an expert guide would please him.\n\n\"The feelings were mixed, but it is my decision and I am looking forward to it.\"\n\n\"You're coming?\" I could hear him holding back the excitement in his voice.\n\n\"Yes, now you had better tell me about those plans of yours.\" I pulled out a new spiral notebook and wrote Cole Family Vacation on the front cover. He smiled. I was starting to think that spending the summer with the Coles was going to do wonders for my weekly totals. Spencer would be so jealous.\n\n\"Shoot!\"\n\n\"Well, the family has a whole bunch of ideas and Mom and Dad have some requirements. I think the whole thing is going to get worked out in a family meeting when we first get back home. There is just one thing I really want to do.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" I wrote 'ideas' at the top of the page and waited.\n\n\"I want to go on an overnight backpacking trip with Christian. We need some guy time and I think he would love it. Plus, it will give us a chance to do things that we couldn't possibly do with the rest of the family.\"\n\nI wrote down backpack trip with Christian and then put Mark's name to indicate whose idea it was. In a family of nine, I was pretty sure there were going to be lots of ideas. \"That shouldn't be too difficult. What part of California are we going to?\"\n\n\"Mom grew up in the Central Valley. She wants us to see Yosemite and the Sequoias.\"\n\n\"How long are we vacationing for?\"\n\n\"A week, plus travel to and from?\"\n\n\"This could get expensive. Do you guys already have all your camping gear?\"\n\n\"No, that is one of the things Mom is hoping you can help her with. She isn't sure what we need. Don't worry about the money. The Cole's aren't rich, but we have been saving for this trip for seven years.\"\n\n\"Seven years? Wow!\"\n\n\"I guess all the other details should wait until we get there, except one. What is your schedule like now?\" he asked.\n\n\"It is a little crazy. I'm finishing up some projects.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm pretty busy now too, but I need you to meet me at my apartment tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"You have got to learn to drive a stick shift so you can use my truck at home.\"\n\n\"Ummm.... I don't know, that sounds a little dangerous. I'll just ride my bike.\" George had tried to teach me once how to drive his stick shift. I'd narrowly avoided an accident.\n\n\"Megan, don't be crazy, it isn't a spaceship or anything. We'll find a deserted parking lot somewhere and you will get it in no time.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said, reluctantly. I put the notebook away and he ran back to his apartment for a board game.\n\nIt was ten o'clock when I got home. Quickly, I put my folded clothes away and climbed into bed. It was time to sleep. Tomorrow was going to be some day. Kneeling on my bed, I thanked Heavenly Father for the Coles and the opportunity they were giving me. I also thanked Him for a loving family and a Dad that wanted me to be happy. Then, I reflected on how much happier I was feeling. It's funny how changes can sometimes happen so slowly you don't even notice.\n\n* * *\n\nI was beginning to see my strengths and talents again. As I felt the Spirit more often, quieting the negative thoughts became a little easier. I discovered, however, that I could not add driving a manual transmission to my list of talents. I was getting frustrated as over and over I stalled Mark's truck in the mall's back parking lot. Luckily, there were few witnesses to my ineptness, but Mark's snickers were bad enough.\n\n\"Sure keep laughing. It's your transmission I'm ruining.\"\n\n\"It's all about timing.\" He tried to look at me seriously, biting his lip so that he wouldn't laugh. \"You'll get it. You just need to get the timing right.\"\n\nAn hour later, I was doing pretty well. I had made it around the mall. Then, I had to start again from a stop sign and I stalled in the middle of the intersection. \"Ahhh!\" I groaned, frantically trying to get out of another car's way. The lot was filling up. I started the engine again, pulled over to a parking spot, and stopped the truck. \"Your turn, I've had enough.\"\n\n\"You are so close. Are you sure you don't want to practice on the real road?\"\n\n\"Definitely not. I am done for the day.\" He was such a good teacher. I wondered where he got all of his patience from.\n\n\"Okay, we will just have to practice again next Saturday. We are running out of time.\"\n\n\"No, not again.\"\n\n\"Are you saying you don't want to be around me,\" Mark teased. \"That's hurtful, Megan, besides you may as well get used to me.\"\n\n\"Good point, I guess you are going to be around a lot. Well, at least I'll have Rebekah for compensation,\" I teased back.\n\n\"Ouch! Hey since we're here, come in with me and help me pick out a present for Nathan.\"\n\nWe returned home two hours later. I had just enough time to work on my biology homework before Melissa's concert. This time I was dressed properly and sitting in the front row. I didn't even laugh when I saw Nathan and Jackie enter holding hands; funny how that was working out. All that talk about returned missionaries and she would be writing a missionary, after all. Shortly after they came in, I saw Mark. I hadn't thought to ask him if he wanted to come. I guess Melissa had. He waved at me and came to sit in the open seat next to me.\n\nAgain, he closed his eyes, listening to the music, and I thought of Mr. Wallace. It was too bad we couldn't have brought him with us. After the concert, we all went back to our apartment for ice cream. The group was upbeat and silly as we talked. Melissa was so thrilled to be finished with her final concert of the year and we all cheered for her.\n\n* * *\n\nThe week flew by in a blur. Much too soon, I was sitting behind the wheel of Mark's truck again. After a quick refresher from last week, he directed me out of the parking lot and onto the city streets. Nervously, I concentrated hard until my hands hurt from squeezing the steering wheel. We made our way into the center of town where there were definitely too many stops.\n\n\"You need a chance to practice changing gears, turn right here. Let's get on the freeway.\"\n\nI looked over to him, terrified. \"What?\"\n\n\"Megan, think about it. The hardest part for you is the starts and stops, right? The freeway will be a piece of cake.\"\n\nI wasn't sure this was true, but I entered the freeway and headed south towards Spanish Fork. He was right; shifting gears was easy enough, once I got used to it. Mark got really good at not wincing when I would grind the gears.\n\nHe told me to take the exit to Spanish Fork Canyon and I panicked because we were going to be back to stops and starts again. I'd had enough practice for one day.\n\n\"Calm down, Megan, you can do it. I thought while we were out we could check out the Canyon. I remember some hot springs up there from before my mission.\"\n\nI was too busy focusing to answer him.\n\nPassing into the shopping area, Mark said, \"Hey, pull in here, I'm starving. You can practice a pick-up window.\" I pulled in and he gave me his order. \"Get something for yourself too, please. I don't want to feel bad eating in front of you; my treat.\"\n\nShaking my head at how early it was for fast food, I ordered some fries and a small root beer. We parked in the lot because there is no easy way to eat while driving a stick shift. I watched Mark woof down two burgers, fries and a milk shake. Wondering where it all went in his lean frame, I said, \"Now I see... your family has been saving lots of money because they haven't had to feed you the last few years. No wonder they can take big vacations.\"\n\nHe laughed, eying my fries. \"Well, at least you're not going to eat them out of house and home this summer. You'll be economical.\"\n\nWe ate in silence for a while. The sun was shining in the window and my skin felt extra warm where it hit. \"How is Mr. Wallace doing?\"\n\nHe smiled, \"Grumpy as usual. He keeps asking about you. I think you're addictive.\" I tossed my wadded fry wrapper at him and he dodged it expertly.\n\n\"I missed,\" I said, pretending frustration.\n\n\"Yeah, you just can't beat me.\" He picked up the projectile and prepared for a counter attack.\n\nQuickly, I directed his attention away from that plan. \"I've been to the springs before. If you want me to get us to the right spot you need to drive so I can think.\" It was a bit of a copout, but I so did not want to drive anymore. I opened the door and jumped out before he could remember his attack or suggest I try mountain driving.\n\nI walked around the truck to the passenger's side. Mark got out too; garbage in hand and to my relief, walked to the trash can. I was safe from retaliation it seemed.\n\nHe came back and stood by the door so that he could close it for me and I thanked him with a curtsey. \"You really are getting so much better at this driving thing,\" he offered, encouragingly.\n\n\"Yeah! I didn't even kill us,\" I teased. Then he grabbed me in a big hug. It was nice and warm there; too nice, I decided. He was always so sweet. I smiled at him, but pulled away and climbed into the truck. I should get used to this. I was going to be spending six weeks with a family of huggers, but I shouldn't get to comfortable.\nChapter 14\n\nWe spent the rest of the day getting lost in the canyon. Finally, we found the trail to the springs. We followed the smell of sulfur the last quarter mile. Kicking our shoes off, we both ran to the springs and I splashed in the shallowest ones. Mark took a more casual approach carefully sitting on a rock and dipping in his feet with his pant legs neatly rolled up.\n\nIt was a lazy afternoon, the warmth of the sun and the springs made the clearing especially pleasant. I dozed happily, watching the bright yellow and red of the sun through my eyelids. I even heard a small snore from Mark's direction.\n\nUnable to resist, I snuck up to him. I was careful not to block the sun on his face and wake him up. Then, I reached into the spring cupping my hands. He awoke with a start as the carefully aimed water hit his face. After that, I could expect little mercy and the water fight was on.\n\nThe sun was heading toward the west when we prepared to head back. \"Next time, I am bringing my swimsuit,\" he said, trying to dry himself off. Giggling like a child, I splashed him again. We both walked slowly along the trail listening to the crack of twigs and the other little sound of the woods. At least our shoes were dry, but the rest of us was dripping.\n\nThe water had started out warm, but by the time we reached the truck, we were both shivering because of our wet clothes. Mark cranked up the heater and then reached behind the seat. \"Here,\" he said, handing me a blanket. I snuggled down under it even though it smelled like metal. It must have been kept right next to a set of old tools or something. Still, I was grateful that he always seemed to be prepared.\n\n\"What do your finals look like?\" he asked as we drove.\n\n\"Not too bad. I'll be done with them by the 21st.\"\n\n\"My last final is on the 20th, but I have to work on the 22nd. Do you mind hanging out for a day or so?\"\n\n\"No, that works great. I can scout apartments for next year. I haven't gotten to that yet.\"\n\n\"Okay, then we will leave on the 23rd. Do you have a lot of stuff?\"\n\n\"Not really, two suitcases, maybe four boxes, and my laptop. Oh, and my bike.\"\n\n\"We should fit fine then. I guess with the computers, we shouldn't pack the truck until Friday morning.\"\n\n\"I hope your family likes me.\"\n\n\"Are you kidding, you may have to beat Christian off with a stick.\"\n\n\"That's not exactly what I meant.\"\n\n\"Megan, have you ever actually met anyone who didn't like you?\"\n\n\"Sure, everyone has.\"\n\n\"Well, I just can't imagine that.\"\n\n\"Oh, what about Mr. Wallace?\" I asked with a laugh.\n\n\"He doesn't like anyone, but he does like you. Like I told you, he's addicted.\"\n\n\"I think he likes you too, Marky.\"\n\n\"No!! Please don't call me that.\" His face was earnest but there was humor there too.\n\n\"I'll consider it.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's a deal is it? What do you want?\"\n\n\"Dinner. I'm starving.\"\n\nHe tilted his head to the side as if he were considering. He smiled and said, \"Deal. Where do you want to go?\"\n\nWe ate in the car again, thanks to our wet, stinky clothes. Away from the hot springs we could once again smell the sulfur and it wasn't good. When we got home, I thanked him for the fun day and excused myself so that I could get dry. The apartment was quiet. It had been that way a lot lately.\n\nJackie was in the kitchen making dinner. \"Hey, where have you been, you smell kind of funny.\"\n\n\"We hiked to the hot springs, it's the sulfur.\"\n\n\"And you're wet.\"\n\n\"Water fight.\"\n\n\"I thought you weren't dating anymore? Who did you go with?\"\n\n\"Mark. He was just teaching me to drive his stick shift. It wasn't a date.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" she said. \"Dinner is almost done. I made enough if you want some, but go shower first.\"\n\n\"It smells really good, but I just ate. The shower sounds like a good idea though. Want to watch a movie when I'm done?\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n* * *\n\nIt was the final week of school and cleaning was a big thing on the agenda, as we prepared to move out of our apartment. It was amazing how many phone messages and church bulletins I found underneath the refrigerator. The bathroom sparkled now. It was cleaner than it had been all year. Aside from the cleaning meeting we had Sunday night, I only caught glimpses of my roommates the next few days. Then, one by one, they all left for home and the apartment was empty except for me.\n\nI no longer felt like I wanted to be alone, so I decided to visit Mr. Wallace. I hopped on my bike and rode through the residential streets of Provo heading for the hospital. There was a lot of activity as people loaded cars with boxes and piles of clothes on hangers. Another year was over already and what a year it had been. I had reached the end of my rope and yet somehow I was still hanging on. It was still hard, but my load was lightening.\n\nMr. Wallace was not exactly pleased to see me, but he was as pleased as he ever gets. I found him, dapper as always, looking out his window.\n\n\"Hi, Mr. Wallace. It's beautiful outside isn't it?\"\n\n\"It's okay, not green enough yet.\"\n\n\"Would you like to go out in the courtyard for a walk?\"\n\n\"Don't you mean ride,\" he said, grimacing at the wheelchair.\n\n\"Either way you still get some fresh air.\"\n\n\"May as well. You'll just talk me to death anyway.\"\n\nI smiled and helped him gently to the chair.\n\n\"All ready?\"\n\n\"Better drive by the nurses' station and let the warden know you're springing me.\"\n\n\"You've got it.\" I pushed him down to the station, smiling at the residents sitting in the hallway. From the looks on their faces, Mr. Wallace was scowling at them. We passed the desk and I spoke up in a stage whisper, \"Hey Mark, Mr. Wallace and I are running away from home. Don't wait up.\"\n\nMark grinned and hollered after us, \"Watch out Mr. Wallace, Megan's trouble.\"\n\nI headed out the glass doors that led to the courtyard. The sun was just starting to set and I was glad that I had grabbed a blanket throw as we left the room. Placing the blanket across Mr. Wallace's lap, I began to stroll around the walk admiring the bright colored bulbs in the flowerbeds.\n\n\"You're trying to freeze me,\" Mr. Wallace complained as he pulled the blanket up tighter.\n\n\"Sorry about that. I guess the sun was making all the difference.\" I stopped the chair for a moment so that we could watch a bird making a nest in one of the three trees in the courtyard. \"Well, the birds seem to think the weather is nice,\" I said, pointing to the twig laden bird in flight.\n\n\"Do you see any feathers?\" Mr. Wallace said, gesturing with his arms as if he was flying. I couldn't help myself, I laughed. To my surprise, Mr. Wallace laughed too. The smile stayed on his face for a moment and then quickly he assumed its normal frown. It was brief, but that was good enough for me. I could finally count a smile from Mr. Wallace. \"Take me inside before I get too much fresh air.\"\n\n\"As you wish,\" I said, waving my hand with a flourish. I took the long way around, circling the building. I hummed a little to myself as I walked. It wasn't quite a tune, just noise, but it gave me something to do while he held his quiet mood.\n\n\"Stop that,\" he complained after a moment. \"If you're going to hum try not to sound like a buzz saw.\"\n\nI stopped immediately and chided, \"Why don't you start us off then.\"\n\nHe began a soft melody that I recognized. I joined in and our hums of \"I am a Child of God\" filled the hallways. Those we passed did double takes as they saw the resident grump humming. I smiled widely because they weren't the only ones surprised by Mr. Wallace tonight. When we came to his room, I pushed him inside and offered to help him to his bed or another chair.\n\nShaking his head, he said, \"Just push that call button over there.\"\n\nI obeyed and Mark appeared in the doorway two minutes later. \"I see you're back. What do you need Mr. Wallace?\"\n\n\"Privacy,\" he grumbled, looking pointedly at me.\n\nI took the hint and gave Mr. Wallace a friendly wave. \"I'll go now. I'm going to miss you this summer, Mr. Wallace. Goodbye.\"\n\n\"Oh, hey, Megan. Wait for me, my shift is almost done,\" Mark said. I nodded and he closed the door.\n\nIn the dining hall, there were a couple of ladies putting a puzzle together. One lady with thick glasses and a crown of soft white curls made an exasperated sound.\n\n\"I just can't tell if that's an eye or a pebble. How are your eyes?\" She asked, looking me up and down.\n\n\"Pretty good, let me see.\" I sat down next to her and we began to work.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, Mark found me. \"Mr. Wallace says to tell you goodbye. Ready to go?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I rose from the table. \"Thanks for letting me help. Have a good night,\" I said to the ladies. They smiled at me and I added three more smiles to my tally.\n\nWe walked out to the truck and I went to retrieve my bike from the pillar where I had chained it. Mark flung it into the back with one effortless movement. He was strong despite his thin appearance.\n\n\"Ice cream?\" I asked when we were on our way.\n\nHe shivered, but said, \"Sure.\" He drove across town to an ice cream and sandwich shop I'd eaten at a few times.\n\nWe lingered over our bowls just talking. I told him all about my visit the bewildering Mr. Wallace. Mark wasn't at all surprised to hear that he had laughed or hummed. \"He's never told you?\"\n\nI gave him a puzzled look and begged, \"Told me what?\"\n\n\"Mr. Wallace taught music at a high school for many years. He is not lacking in a sense of humor or a love of music. You have to catch him in the right mood, but he has some great stories. He's just lonely and unhappy.\"\n\n\"That much I had gathered.\" I said dryly and we both chuckled. \"Long day tomorrow.\" I was feeling excited for an adventure.\n\n\"Speaking of which, we had better get home if we want to get an early start. I still have some packing to do.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have pulled you away from that.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly. This was fun and I love ice cream.\"\n\n\"I can tell,\" I said, looking at his empty banana split bowl.\n\nHe lightheartedly complained, \"Hey, this was dinner.\"\n\n\"You hadn't eaten yet?\"\n\n\"Not since my lunch break at 2.\" He looked as his watch as he spoke. \"9 o'clock already?\"\n\n\"They have sandwiches here too, you know. Do you want anything else?\"\n\n\"No, I'm good. I need to get home, there's lots left to do.\"\n\nI flagged down the waitress and ordered a sandwich to go. \"This will just take a minute. If you're going to have a late night you might want it.\" His answering grin was almost blinding. \"It's just a sandwich. It isn't like I gave you a kidney or anything,\" I observed, but I happily counted his smile.\n\n\"I know. I just think it's cool that you care.\"\n\nWell, of course, I cared. Had I been so awful this winter that people thought me heartless? How did I respond to that? We got the sandwich and left.\n\n\"I will knock about 6 in the morning and you can start bringing your stuff out.\"\n\n\"Okay, I hope you get some sleep.\"\n\nI decided it would be easier in the morning if my stuff was all ready by the door. I moved it and then slept on the couch so I wouldn't miss the knock in the morning.\n\n* * *\n\nI learned on the way to Idaho that Mark was a huge fan of a cappella music. His mp3 collection was extensive and listening to it was surprisingly fun. It was impossible not to sing along as we drove down the long highway. Again, I was reminded of times with George, but Mark was definitely a better singer. He carried on harmonies and I tried to keep up with the melodies. Smiling and laughing and singing felt so good. I wondered if his whole family was as cheerful. Perhaps they would be good for me in more ways than one.\n\nMark also asked me lots of questions about my business plan and my camp plans in general. He was very encouraging and it made me feel good. My roommates had rolled their eyes when I started talking about my plans, but Mark was really listening. There were still two years of school ahead of me, but the plans had been an important distraction, and I was attached to them. The enthusiasm that had come from listening to others' experiences was still strong, and it was nice that someone else seemed excited too.\n\n\"Where do you think you want your camp to be?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure. I have been casually looking at real estate,\" I admitted. This had been one part of the plan I hadn't discussed with friends, because I was worried that they would laugh at my prematurity. \"California, although beautiful, is just going to be too expensive. Arizona is so dry most of the time that campfires are often prohibited even in the forests. I was thinking about Utah, but it is getting expensive too, in a couple of years I am just not sure I could swing it.\"\n\n\"Have you considered Idaho?\"\n\n\"Actually, I've been thinking about it since your family invited me. I'm not sure about hiking and things there. Maybe I can get a better idea during my visit.\"\n\n\"So much of Idaho I haven't even seen. There must be a lot to explore,\" he said. Stretching the muscles in his neck, he wiped his eyes with his hand. \"Do you think you could drive for a while? That late night is creeping up on me.\"\n\nI shrunk at the idea, but agreed to take over. There were a few hesitations as I pulled away from the curb on the off ramp where we had stopped, but I managed to get us back on the highway. Once I was in fourth gear I relaxed.\n\n\"Good job! You're getting better,\" Mark offered, as he rolled his long legs to the side and laid his head against the window. \"Just stay on this road we have about three hours left.\"\n\nThe miles flew by and before long, we were nearing our destination. I reached over and shook Marks shoulder as we passed a sign indicating that Twin Falls was about 20 minutes away. The Coles lived in the country just outside of Twin Falls. I was completely unfamiliar with the area, so I felt better with him awake. This way he could navigate the last bit.\n\nHe sat up, stretched his neck and rolled his shoulders. Looking at his watch, he blinked. \"I'm sorry I slept so long, Megan.\"\n\n\"It's okay. You must have needed it. You seem pretty good at sleeping on the road. I'm always wide awake; it gets a little annoying on long trips because then I arrive all tired out.\"\n\n\"Trust me, the falling asleep can get annoying too. Once on a scout trip I fell asleep. When I woke up my legs were tied together with bandages. It took me twenty minutes to get through all the knots.\"\n\n\"So many things I missed, not being a boy scout,\" I complained with a smirk.\n\nWe passed another sign showing our destination was even closer. I started to feel a little nervous again, hoping that the Coles would like me. They were stuck with me for a month and a half. It would be horrible if I was a burden. I tried to distract myself by asking questions.\n\n\"So tell me more about your mom and dad. You haven't said much about them.\"\n\n\"Mom is short with long, curly, red hair. I was taller than she was by the time I was 12. The last I knew, Caleb was well on his way to being taller too. Anyway, Mom loves music and is always singing. She has a degree in the humanities and is always taking us to concerts and plays. But she is playful too. Once, when I was seven, she hustled me at arm wrestling.\" He laughed at the memory.\n\n\"What? How did she do that?\"\n\n\"I wanted to stay up late, so she said if I beat her at arm wrestling that I could stay up. I beat her so fast. I thought I was the strongest kid ever. She suggested we do it again. This time if I won, I got to stay up all week, and if she won, I had to take the trash out for a week. Well, you can guess what happened.\"\n\n\"I think I am going to like your mom.\" I could almost see his little seven year old face, sad with defeat and disbelief.\n\n\"You've met my dad so you know how he is; upbeat and big hearted. He would growl like a big bear, reach for me, and tickle me until I couldn't laugh anymore. He is also a master carpenter. It's more of a hobby now, but it paid his way through school. He has taught each of us boys how to work with wood. He would have taught the girls too, but Rebekah wasn't very interested and Anna and Ruth are still a bit young. I understand that they both help with clean up duties in the workshop now.\"\n\n\"What does your dad do for a living?\"\n\n\"He's an accountant, that's why our family is so good at saving. He keeps us on a tight budget.\"\n\n\"Maybe I can take some lessons from him. I am going to need to save up a fair amount before a bank will even consider me for a business loan.\"\n\n\"Saving is a part of life when you adopt. My parents have a special account just for adoptions. Over the years, we all contributed to the account. It got us excited about helping our new brother or sister come to live with us. Anna was the last adoption a little over seven years ago. We started saving again right after she came home, but we never needed the money. Mom and Dad were completely surprised when Ruth came along. It's that savings that we are using for the vacation, there is probably close to $12,000 in it.\"\n\nMy eyes bugged out at the amount and then I asked, \"Why didn't you need the money for Ruth. Oh, right she wasn't adopted.\"\n\n\"No, she is the only natural child in the family. Mom and Dad were told they would never have kids.\"\n\n\"So is that weird or anything?\" I paused. \"Sorry, I guess that is kind of a personal question.\"\n\n\"No worries. It actually doesn't make one bit of difference. Mom and Dad love us all just as much. I will say this though, it does give Ruth the prettiest red curly hair.\"\n\n* * *\n\nWe had turned off the highway and were driving down a rural road, passing farm houses and barns. After about fifteen minutes, Mark had me pull into a long double driveway full of a big white van and two small cars.\n\nThe front yard was full of trees; most looked like they bore fruit of some kind, but it was too early in the season to tell what. There were bikes piled by the garage door and an abandoned doghouse just off of the driveway.\n\nMark leaned over and honked the horn. Kids poured through the front door. School had probably been out for about an hour and they looked like they hadn't been doing anything but waiting. I recognized Ruth right away thanks to her red hair. Mark was right, it was definitely beautiful. Caleb, I assumed, was the tall dark skinned boy with the largest dimples I had ever seen. Anna, who was blind, was slowly making her way to the tree next to the drive. She held onto the trunk and waited. Mark jumped out and grabbed the two that had run up to the truck. He had both of them in a headlock within seconds.\n\nCaleb fought against him and managed to twist out because Ruth was giggling so much that Mark started laughing too. Scooping Ruth up onto his hip, he hurried over to Anna and wrapped her in a big hug. She giggled and turned her smiling face up to her big brother.\n\nIt felt like I was intruding on this private scene, so I stayed where I was standing next to the truck. Mark whipped his head around looking for me. \"Come on over, Megan. Meet the rug rats.\"\n\nSmiling, I ventured over to the small crowd. \"This is Caleb, Anna and Ruth,\" he said, giving each a squeeze as he said their name.\n\n\"Nice to meet you,\" I said politely. Ruth grabbed my hand and held it while we walked into the house. She swung our hands back and forth, as we went, and it made me want to skip like I did when I was her age.\n\nWe walked through the front door into an entry way that was crowded with shoes and backpacks. Rebekah came in from the kitchen with an apple and Christian ran up the stairs when he heard all the noise. Rebekah and I hugged each other like old friends. She asked me about the trip, while I watched Mark and Christian wrestle, bumping into things in their exuberance. Sister Cole, who was sitting in the living room just off the entry with Micah, hollered for them to stop. She looked pointedly at Mark until he introduced me.\n\n\"Sorry, Mom. This is Megan.\"\n\n\"It's very nice to finally meet you, Megan,\" Sister Cole said. \"This is Micah.\"\n\nI walked closer so that Micah could see me, \"Thank you so much for the invitation. I am very excited to spend this time with your family. Hi, Micah,\" I reached out to hold his hand. Mark's little brother was bent in a rigid pose that looked uncomfortable. His head, full of brassy blond hair, was turned to the side resting on the headrest of his chair.\n\n\"Well, we will see if you still feel that way in a month,\" Sister Cole said. She was glaring at the boys again because Christian had started poking Mark's side. Mark barely noticed Christian's attempts. He just stood there with an expression on his face I couldn't place. His look at me was so intense that I should have felt uncomfortable, but I wasn't.\n\nMark shook his head and seemed then to notice Christian's attack. \"Oh, and this is Christian,\" Mark said, putting his hand on the shoulder of his younger brother. He was a younger brother, but not a little brother. Christian had grown just a little taller than Mark, despite the fact that he was only 17. He had dark eyes and brown hair about the color of Marks, but without the red highlights. His skin was covered with the usual pimples of adolescence and his upper lip bore a large scar indicating a former cleft palette. Christian grinned wide and I thought in that moment that I could see a lot of resemblance between him and Mark. They were both just so happy.\n\nHe walked over to me and made a theatrical bow. \"Hello, Megan, so glad to meet you.\" He actually kissed my hand. I looked up to Mark for help and he gently shoved Christian off balance.\n\n\"Okay, give Megan her hand back.\"\n\nSister Cole chuckled softly on the couch. Micah decided he had been ignored long enough and he made a loud whining noise. Mark went straight to him and touched his face. He made a shhhing sound and talked quietly to him about our trip home. I could hear the soft reassuring words. I talked to Micah about our trip too and about how Mark seemed to be able to sleep anywhere. This won a laugh from Sister Cole.\n\nRebekah pulled me away to show me her room. It was purple and the walls were covered with pictures of friends. She offered me her bed, but I was fine with sleeping of the floor. After all, she still had a month of school left and I was prepared for roughing it. She had emptied two drawers for me and cleared some space in the closet, too. It was such a welcoming thing to do even if it destroyed my plans for living out of a suitcase. I was going to have to get more settled in than that.\n\nWhen I came out of her room, Mark was still talking to Micah. I didn't want to disturb him so I went to unpack the truck. It had been decided that my things would be stored in the basement corner so I recruited Caleb and Christian to show me the way and to carry the boxes. They seemed happy to help when I gave them the left over cookies from the trip. \"Hey,\" Mark protested, when he saw them running past him with the bag. \"I was going to eat those later.\"\n\n\"Too late, I had to tip the bellboys.\"\n\nHe looked at his truck and sighed, realizing that he also had to unload. \"Do we have any more food to bribe them with? Some of this stuff is heavy.\"\n\n\"Nope. That was the last of it, but I'll help you.\" I reached in for a box and then dropped it back into the bed. \"What is in this? It weighs a ton.\"\n\n\"My nursing books, some of them are pretty heavy. I probably shouldn't have packed them all in one box. Just leave that one. I'll get it.\"\n\n\"I don't think I have ever asked you why you want to be a nurse.\" I grabbed a soft sided duffel, hoping that it would be lighter.\n\n\"Not really sure how it happened. You know that I took the CNA training so that I could help with Micah. Well, I got to help out in the hospital as part of my class and I really liked working with the patients. I guess it just seemed like a good way to go.\"\n\n\"It suits you. I just always think of nurses as women.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure if there is an insult in there or not,\" he said, laughing.\n\nFlustered, I back tracked, \"I'm sorry, I just meant that it is kind of an unusual job for a man, but you will make a really good nurse. You have a lot of compassion.\"\n\n\"Actually, male nurses are not as unusual as you think. My mom even had a male maternity nurse when she had Ruth. The work is steady and it pays really well, so it is a good job for men to support their families on.\"\n\n\"Your mom had a male maternity nurse? How embarrassing.\"\n\n\"Not really, she seemed fine with it. I guess he was good at his job.\"\n\nMy sleepy eyes popped open. \"Are you going to go into maternity nursing?\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" he said, wrinkling his nose. \"But I haven't completely decided yet.\"\n\n\"You would be good in any field, but watching you with your brothers and sister I'm thinking pediatrics.\"\n\n\"Wow, that's a long way from Mr. Wallace.\"\n\n\"Good point. Don't tell him I suggested it.\" We laughed.\n\n* * *\n\nWith the truck unloaded, it was time to pitch in and set the table for dinner. Brother Cole would be home soon. His arrival was hard to miss because Ruth went bursting through the front door, \"Daddy's home!\"\n\n\"Wow! That was enthusiastic.\" I said, looking after her.\n\n\"Yeah, it's that 'I'm so glad when Daddy comes home' song. Mom starts brainwashing us with that one while we are still in a bassinet.\"\n\n\"I heard that,\" Sister Cole called from the kitchen.\n\nAnna appeared in the entryway and Mark scooped her up and went out into the yard so that they could greet their Dad, too. Reluctantly, I followed, not wanting to intrude. Brother Cole stepped out of his land barge and it shook. After he put Anna down, Mark received a big bear hug from the large, gentle man. Then the girls each grabbed onto their Daddy's legs and he tried to walk towards the house.\n\n\"Megan,\" a booming voice said and I waved shyly at him.\n\n\"You're destined for a bear hug, Megan. You may as well get it over with,\" Mark smirked.\n\nI walked forward holding out my hand as if for a shake, but of course, Brother Cole hugged me. It wasn't as powerful as the hug he had given Mark, but then, I barely knew him. He handed Mark his briefcase and scooped a girl up in each arm. They both kissed his cheeks. \"Welcome to the Coles, Megan,\" Brother Cole called over his shoulder as he walked toward the house.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I called after him.\n\nIf I thought that Brother Cole was big before, I was shocked beyond coherent speech when I saw Brother and Sister Cole together. Brother Cole dropped both girls to their feet beside the table and walked over to his wife to give her a kiss. He bent down, he bent way down and she obligingly stood on tiptoe. Biting my lip, I tried to control my giggles, but I had never seen such a mismatched couple. Thankfully, they seemed rather focused on the kiss and oblivious to my reaction.\nChapter 15\n\nAfter dinner, it was time for the family meeting. I grabbed my notebook and pen, and found the family sitting in the room just off of the kitchen. There was a fireplace and a sliding glass door to the backyard, but it wasn't quite big enough to be a family room, especially not for this family. Brother Cole sat on the hearth and asked Christian to offer a prayer. Sister Cole also was prepared to take notes.\n\nThe meeting began with Brother Cole reintroducing me to the family and explaining why I was there. \"Megan has some practice at this sort of thing so she will be helping us have the best vacation possible. We leave in a few weeks and we need some opinions.\" He held his hand up to quiet the excited responses. \"We will try to do at least one thing that each of you really wants to do but it has to be reasonable.\"\n\nSister Cole spoke up, \"We are going to California because I have always wanted to show you the mountains there. A trip to Yosemite and to Sequoia and Kings Canyon National parks is already on the list. Let's take turns, youngest first. What would you like to do, Ruth?\"\n\n\"Can we go to the zoo?\" She was so hopeful, holding her hands together in a pleading way. Anna's wrinkled up face made me smile. I was pretty sure she was remembering the smell of the last zoo she had been to. Sister Cole wrote it on her list and I wrote it on mine with Ruth's name next to it. Then, I added a note to remind me about Anna's reaction.\n\n\"Anna?\" Brother Cole asked.\n\nAnna thought for a minute, \"I really want to eat one of the peaches that Mom's always talking about.\" She licked her lips expectantly. \"You know, the really juicy ones you used to eat right off the tree.\"\n\n\"That's not very much. Don't you want something else, dear?\" Sister Cole coaxed.\n\n\"Nope, that's it.\" I made a note in my book.\n\nCaleb didn't wait for his name to be called, \"Can we go on a roller coaster?\"\n\n\"Sorry son we aren't going to any amusement parks,\" Brother Cole said.\n\n\"Oh,\" Caleb said, a little disappointed. \"Then can we go fishing?\"\n\n\"That is a possibility,\" Brother Cole said approvingly.\n\nI wrote down both requests in my book just in case. Maybe we could find a good roller coaster substitute.\n\nBrother Cole took a moment with his next son. He placed a gentle hand on his shoulder, \"Micah, we're going on a trip. Won't that be fun? We will try to do something you like too.\" He looked around the room at the family, \"Any ideas?\"\n\n\"We could go to a concert or something,\" Christian suggested.\n\n\"I think he would like to see the monkeys like me!\" Ruth said, jumping up and down.\n\n\"He'll like campfires,\" Rebekah said. \"When I went with Megan we told stories and sang songs.\"\n\n\"I think he would like that too. But we will need to do it before it gets too dark or he might get scared,\" Mark agreed.\n\n\"We have some good suggestions. Let's move on,\" Brother Cole said.\n\nIt was Rebekah's turn. \"I don't care what we do as long as I don't have to sleep on the ground.\" Apparently, no one was surprised by this response. I added it to the list.\n\nIt was Christian's turn and he began slowly. \"Mark and I have been talking... I want to go on a backpacking trip with him.\"\n\n\"That's my suggestion too,\" added Mark.\n\nWe had gone through everyone so I closed up my notebook preparing to finish the meeting. As I looked up, everyone was staring at me. What was I supposed to do? Did they want me to give them an itinerary now? The dinner in my stomach was starting to churn with nerves.\n\n\"What about you, Megan? What would you like to do?\"\n\nOh, they were giving me a chance to pick something. Immediately, I relaxed. \"I'm fine. I think the whole trip sounds wonderful. I want one of those peaches, too. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.\"\n\nBrother Cole closed the meeting. Everyone scattered and I opened my book again to look through the list, not sure where to begin. I didn't want to be unprepared the next time.\n\nSister Cole called as she left, \"We can talk about the details tomorrow, Megan. Have a good night.\"\n\nThe family dispersed and I stood to follow, not quite sure where to go. Mark stopped Christian by the stairs. \"So, where are you going on your date tomorrow?\"\n\n\"I have no idea, I want it to be really great,\" Christian almost whined.\n\n\"What's her name and what does she like to do?\" I asked, jumping into my planning mode and the conversation.\n\n\"Her name is Allison. She's on the volleyball team and I think she reads a lot. I guess I could take her to a game or a movie or something.\"\n\n\"Do you really like her?\" Mark asked. Christian nodded. \"Then don't be so boring. Anyone can take her to a movie, besides at the movies you don't get to talk.\"\n\n\"But then where can I take her?\"\n\n\"You should really ask Megan, she is so good at this stuff.\" Mark turned it over to me.\n\nChristian looked at me expectantly. Thanks, Mark. \"Well, I can tell you about some of my favorite things if that would help. Let's see, picnics are always good, and then there is hiking or bike rides. I tried paintball tag last year and it is awesome. That could be a really fun date. There's kite flying, roller skating... lots of things, take your pick.\"\n\n\"There's a place to do paintball in the next town.\"\n\n\"Do you think Allison would like paintball?\" Mark asked.\n\n\"Sure, she's cool.\" Christian nodded.\n\nMark and I looked at each other. He rolled his eyes slightly and I offered some advice to Christian. \"Now if you are choosing paintball you have to call her tonight and tell her to dress for it.\"\n\n\"What should we wear?\"\n\n\"You need grubby clothes, ones you can crawl around in the dirt with and get paint on. They should be comfortable too.\"\n\nChristian turned his head between Mark and me. \"We should double.\"\n\nMark shifted uneasily. \"Megan doesn't date.\"\n\nChristian looked confused by this statement, but quickly turned to me and pleaded. \"Come on. It will be more fun with you guys there and I want her to have fun.\"\n\nI looked back at Mark who was standing there with one eyebrow cocked at me. \"Sure, why not. I like paintball and it isn't as if it would really be a date. We're just helping Christian.\"\n\nMark's mouth twitched a little at the corners and then he turned to Christian, \"Okay, it looks like we're in. What time is the date?\"\n\n\"I told her about four. She wanted to get home early enough to prepare a talk for church. Thanks guys!\" Christian hugged me then headed downstairs with the phone in his hand.\n\n\"Seems we are going out.\" Mark winked at me. I rolled my eyes. \"Do you have the proper clothing Miss,\" he said.\n\n\"I think I can manage. You?\"\n\n\"I have plenty of old scrubs that need retiring.\"\n\n\"You should wear the bright blue ones, they bring out your eyes,\" I teased and his eyebrow rose again; his eyes were brown. \"Okay, it would just make you an easier target.\"\n\n\"Hey, we're going to be on the same team, remember?\"\n\n\"Oh, I was hoping for boys vs. girls.\" I puckered out my lip and hung my head. He grabbed me in a bear hug reminiscent of the ones I saw Brother Cole give him. I giggled.\n\n* * *\n\nMy meeting with Sister Cole, the next morning, was intense. Getting a large family moving was a big undertaking; no wonder my mom was always late everywhere. We talked briefly about food, but decided to have a special meeting just for planning the menu because Christian was allergic to wheat and Brother Cole was diabetic. There was some basic camping gear they needed to purchase, so we made a list. The biggest things on the list were the tents that we needed. After some discussion, we realized that we couldn't provide Micah with the things he needed in a tent. Sister Cole thought she could borrow her parents' RV and left to call them. They had retired to Nevada and a stop at their house was already on the list. If we could use the RV, Rebekah's desire not to sleep on the ground would be all taken care of, as well.\n\nI left the meeting with a list of things to do. I needed to research zoos in the area, and to look for campgrounds that could accommodate both tents and an RV. There was also the backpacking trip to organize. Sister Cole had decided to see if she could find an old ward member who owned an orchard. Maybe Anna would get to pick her peach right off the tree, just like her mom had.\n\n* * *\n\nThat afternoon we were decked out in our grubby clothes and heading for the paintball field. Mark and I were squished into the back seat of Christian's car. No one was talking. \"So have you ever played paintball before?\" I asked, hoping to start the conversation.\n\nAllison gave a timid, \"No, but I have always wanted to try. It looks fun.\" She looked beseechingly at Christian who stared at the road. I wondered if we were cramping his style. In the day that I had known him, he hadn't seemed shy, but I really didn't know him all that well. I looked over at Mark with the same beseeching look. I didn't want to embarrass Christian with one of my jokes.\n\n\"Christian says you're on the volleyball team. How did you guys do this year?\" Mark jumped in, trying to start the conversation.\n\n\"Okay, I guess. We didn't quite have the power this year that we had last year,\" Allison's voice trailed off as she turned to look out her side window. She was obviously nervous too. Remembering that feeling, I smiled. This at least was one aspect of dating I was not going to miss.\n\nMark pressed on. \"He also says you like to read. What have you been reading lately?\"\n\n\"Mostly books for school,\" It looked like we had come to another dead end but then she continued, \"I just started this really great book, though...\" The rest of the ride was filled with a detailed account of the mystery that Allison was reading. Finally, coming out of her shell, she talked animatedly and even turned in her seat so that she could see all of us a bit better. Christian remained quiet, but at least he acted interested. Mark was attentive with questions and comments that made Allison light up.\n\nWhen we arrived, I unbent myself from the back seat, feeling relieved, and then turned to find Mark attempting the same feat. I realized that he was at least eight inches taller than me, most of which was leg and that the back was a lot more cramped for him. It reminded me of when we first met. Thinking I could help him out, I yanked hard on his arms and we both fell to the ground laughing. Christian stared at us in horror; I guessed that we were being embarrassing. \"Well at least we broke our clothes in,\" I said, standing up and brushing off.\n\nAfter we were instructed in the rules and how to use our equipment, we were turned loose to play a game of capture the flag. I was helping Allison with her safety gear when Christian spoke up, \"I call Megan!\"\n\nMark and I stared at each other dumbfounded. This was not a scenario we had pictured. Mark thinking quickly said, \"Okay, then I get Allison. Come on Allison let's take the far field.\"\n\nThankfully, Mark handled it so smoothly it seemed planned. Walking past Christian, he shook his head. \"Nice, Christian,\" I said, when they were out of earshot.\n\n\"What?\" he asked, bewildered.\n\n\"You should have teamed with Allison; you know... your date.\"\n\n\"But you've played this before; I have a better chance with you.\"\n\nI couldn't believe what I was hearing, \"Christian sometimes it's not about winning. Let's get going.\" I turned and headed to the fort at the south end of the field where our flag would be placed.\n\n\"You stay here and guard. I'll go after their flag,\" Christian said, grabbing his gun and heading up the field.\n\n\"Christian, wait. A direct assault is going to get you shot. Come here and let's plan.\"\n\nI grabbed a stick and drew the field with the two towers and the woods that lay on either side. The woods were only about 50 feet wide but it was enough for cover. \"Now they're going to be going through the woods too, so you have to try not to get caught. If you go down the open field, they can get you from the cover of the trees. So it's a fifty-fifty shot on which woods we choose. The smart thing to do is put your flag at the highest point so that the enemy has to expose themselves to grab it. I can guard from the cover of the trees over here,\" I said, pointing to the west side of the field. \"You should take the east so that you can get them it they come from that side. Let me get into position, then you start. And keep your head down.\"\n\nChristian nodded and then ran off before I had even made it to the trees. He definitely had a mind of his own. I searched until I found a fallen log. Laying down behind it, I rested my gun on the log and waited. This was the part that I loved. Although I preferred to be on the offensive, the anticipation of an intruder made this post a rush. As I tried to heighten all my senses, sounds can to me. There was a rustling in the brush that I was pretty sure was coming from the east woods. I hoped that Christian was on his guard. I was starting to feel a little jumpy as the minutes passed. I tried to stay still and alert. Surely, they would be closing in soon. In the distance, I heard a loud, \"Oh, man! I'm out.\" It was Christian.\n\nNow I had no team member to retrieve the flag. I thought for a minute trying to decide what to do. If I waited until they made a play for the flag, I could pick at least one of them off and have a better chance at an offensive. If I moved toward their flag I might be fast enough to get their before they got ours, but I didn't know what kind of head start they had already. Fun won out over reason. In the end, going for the flag seemed like more fun.\n\nJumping up and walking in a crouched position, I moved from tree to tree listening all the while for movement from my opponents. I heard a step once so I quickly ducked behind a tree, staying low. I stayed crouched for a minute or so listening, but I didn't hear anything else, so I continued. About half way through the woods, I looked back quickly towards our fort hoping that our flag was still waving. Pleased that I could still see it, I started again toward my target. A moment later, I was shot in the back.\n\nHow had they gotten behind me? I looked around and saw Mark standing out from behind his tree and blowing across the top of his gun barrel as if he was Clint Eastwood. \"I'm hit. Game over,\" I called out.\n\n\"Not quite, I still need to get your flag.\"\n\n\"I can't believe it, all those years playing capture the flag with my brothers and you actually snuck up on me.\"\n\n\"It's all about being patient.\" He smiled, \"I've been waiting here since the beginning.\"\n\n\"So, you're guarding the flag? Then who shot Christian?\"\n\n\"Commander Allison,\" he grinned and then we both chuckled. I may have lost at capture the flag, but my total for the week was going to be big thanks to this guy.\n\nThere was a cry of victory. We looked to see Allison walking casually through the open field carrying our flag back to her fort.\n\n\"Now it's game over.\" Mark winked.\n\nThe game had gone so quickly that we decided to play again. Mark suggested, before any more social mistakes could be made, \"We should change teams, you guys need some lessons in strategy. Allison and I can help you there.\"\n\nChristian jumped up from the ground where he had been sitting. \"Okay, I get Allison. That was some shot,\" he said, rubbing his shoulder where a splatter of pink paint still remained. They walked to the south end fort and the game began again.\n\nThis time the game took a lot longer, everyone was feeling very cautious and movement was slow. At least, I assumed it was caution, but it could have been conversation. Just for fun, Mark and I had decided to take the west woods together leaving our flag unguarded. I shot a tree once in his defense, but we never did see the other team.\n\nThey must have been just bit faster than we were, because our flag was gone by the time we reached theirs. We hurried down the fort ladder and ran for our home base through the open field. It was risky, but we were having a great time. Half way across the field, we were picked off by a sniper in the east woods. We flopped on the ground panting from our exertions, and laughing while Allison once again gained a victory.\n\nOn the way home, we stopped to eat. Allison and Christian were talking energetically as they sat down at a small table outside. I walked over to the edge of the parking lot looking out towards the mountains. Mark followed. \"It is pretty here,\" I said and Mark nodded agreement, looking out over the same view. \"Allison is lucky she had such a nice date like you.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm just so awesome I can take two girls on one date.\" I gently slapped his shoulder. He wrapped his arm around me and squeezed.\n\n\"You did good. They look like they are getting along great now.\"\n\n\"Well, he is my brother,\" Mark said, blowing on his knuckles and brushing them on his coat. I giggled. He sobered, shaking his head, \"And the kid was just so clueless.\" I nodded emphatically at that.\n\n* * *\n\nWork started for both of us on Monday. I was teaching after-school groups of the cutest little Level 2 kids. They were so excited to be learning that they could actually swim. My mornings were free, so I spent them researching for the trip and helping Sister Cole around the house.\n\nOne day, I was helping Sister Cole fold some laundry when she said, \"Megan, can I ask you something?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said.\n\n\"Forgive me, but Mark said you were having some problems. I just wondered if you are feeling better.\"\n\nOh, no! What had he told her? Then, I looked up into her caring eyes and I figured she would know how I felt. Maybe I could talk to her. \"How much did he tell you?\"\n\n\"Enough,\" she said smiling. \"He was concerned about you and thought I might know what to do.\"\n\n\"Sounds like Mark. He is always trying to make things better.\"\n\n\"Yes, he is a bit of a busy body.\"\n\nLaughing at the unflattering description that I had used myself, I realized it didn't fit. Mark always acted because he cared and that just wasn't the same thing as being a busy body.\n\n\"My sister in law is having a baby,\" I said, feeling a little guilty because it still hurt.\n\n\"Yep, I've been through that one. It does get better. I don't even think about it anymore. A household of kids keeping you busy takes your mind off things. Still before Ruth...\" She looked into the distance for a moment, remembering. \"I was occasionally sad because I thought I would never feel a baby move inside me or vomit up my breakfast like everyone else having kids around me.\"\n\n\"What did you do?\"\n\n\"Well, sometimes I just cried and sometimes I got mad, but always I just kept doing what I needed to. Of course, now I have had that experience. But each one of our kids was an experience all their own. When we brought Mark home from the hospital, I had no idea what I was doing. You would think that by the time we had Ruth it would be all figured out, but each child has brought their own challenges.\"\n\n\"Can I ask a personal question?\"\n\n\"Of course, ask me anything.\" Her response was genuine and I felt like I was talking to a dear sister.\n\n\"My parents are always talking about how great it will be when we are all grown up and they are alone again. I mean, they love us, but they want...\" I trailed off not knowing how to finish. Sister Cole smiled knowingly at me and nodded her head. \"I was just wondering why you adopted a child that can never live on his own. Sorry, I love Micah, he is so sweet, but what made you make that choice when you didn't have to?\"\n\n\"When we decided to adopt, John and I knew that our family would be eternal. We prayed for help to find the children that were supposed to be part of our family and then we listened for the answers. Sometimes the answers were hard. We've turned down several adoption opportunities over the years because it didn't feel right. There are so many children out there that need love. I wished I could bring them all home. But when we did find the child that was ours, we knew it and we just accepted the challenges. We have always made the other kids part of the process so that they would know that their new brother or sister was theirs to keep and that Heavenly Father had sent them.\"\n\n\"You and Brother Cole must have a lot of faith.\"\n\n\"Sometimes, we stumble just like everyone else. Some days, I wish I could run away.\"\n\nI laughed. \"My mom says the same thing.\" I made a mental note to find some alone time for Sister Cole on the trip.\n\n\"Did you know before you got married that you were going to have problems having kids?\"\n\n\"No. We discovered it after a couple of years of trying. Those were hard years and then when we found out, I felt guilty. I couldn't help feeling as if it was all my fault. Father's Days were worse than Mother's Days because I felt like I was the reason John would never be a father.\"\n\nI nodded my head in agreement. I knew exactly how she felt. She continued, \"So here you sit with the knowledge and guilt. Is that why you don't date or is it still Andy?\"\n\n\"No, it's not Andy. I don't think I ever loved him. I can't date because I can't fall in love and get married like anyone else. No one deserves to be stuck with me and my problems.\" It still hurt to say it, but talking to Sister Cole, well, at least she understood.\n\n\"That is a tough one. If I had known before I was married, I may have felt the same way. It took me several years before I realized that Heavenly Father didn't think I was damaged, and neither did John. I was the only one that needed convincing. John just kept telling me to have hope and he was right. Hope has never let me down. Maybe you shouldn't give up on life just yet.\" She smiled at me, scooped up a stack of clothes and went to deliver it to the girls' room.\nChapter 16\n\nSister Cole had given me some things to think about. I rode my bike to work that afternoon without the normal mp3 distraction, so that I could think about hope. It was the last day of class for this group. As I gave them their final swim test and filled out their certificates, I pondered. Many of the kids gave me hugs as they left and thanked me. It was always rewarding to help them learn something that I enjoyed so much.\n\nLooking at the Idaho countryside on the way home, I could see beauties everywhere. There was certainly a lot of evidence for hope if I looked hard enough for it, but my hurts were still there, even if I was feeling them less lately.\n\nI pulled on my sweats for sleeping and grabbed my scriptures, quietly exiting the teenage domain of Rebekah. She was in a heated debate with her friend Katie about a 'he said she said' thing that had happened at school. The sitting room with the fireplace was surprisingly quiet given the house's usual liveliness. I sat on the end of the couch nearest the lamp, tucked my legs underneath myself, and opened my D&C.\n\nI hadn't quite gotten out of the habit of chronological study. It just made so much more sense to me when I could place things in their context, but I had just recently studied the D&C in class so I felt a little more aware and able to pick and choose. For some reason, I opened to Section 121.\n\nMy habit of daily scripture reading was only three years old and some nights it still turned into the obligatory chapter. During my darker months this winter, I had stopped reading all together. I was still trying to reestablish the habit.\n\nThe front door opened as I finished my prayer. It must be Mark coming home from work. He had begun a full time schedule of shifts at the nursing home in the neighboring town, the first week we were back. Perking up, I realized that I had missed him so much this last week.\n\nHe must have found the house unusually quiet as well because he began a room by room search. Passing through the kitchen, he spotted me and came over. I smiled up at him. Seeing my scriptures and being unwilling to break the odd quiet, he whispered, \"Where is everyone?\"\n\n\"Rebekah is in her room on the phone.\" He rolled his eyes at that news. \"And I think everyone else is down in the family room watching a movie,\" I said, pointing through the floor to the basement. He nodded his head quietly and backed out of the room.\n\nI guessed he was going down to join them. I wanted to follow him, but my reading times had been so erratic lately with all the family hustle and bustle. I really needed to discipline myself. Still, with Mark home, it was harder. I liked his company. I tried not to make deals with myself about speeding up so that I could join them\u2013that would just reward my hurried study. Looking back down at my scriptures, I began to read.\n\nHeavy breathing stole my attention. It was Mark, changed out of his scrubs and carrying his scriptures. He was all breathless, apparently from his speedy change. His smile was brilliant as I looked at him, puzzled. \"Can I join you? Where are you reading?\" He was walking forward now not waiting for a response. He climbed into the chair positioned under the same lamp with a sigh.\n\n\"Tough day?\" I could see now that he looked very tired.\n\n\"Tough, but good.\" He answered then removed his triple from its case still closely looking at my scriptures for where to turn.\n\nI woke up mentally at that point and gave him the reference. \"I am in D&C 121, you know, Liberty Jail.\" He quickly turned to the chapter and I could see that he was still using his mission scriptures because the markings were extensive. My own scriptures were only occasionally marked, except for my Book of Mormon that I had marked for a religion class.\n\nHe looked up at me. \"How do you want to do this?\" I motioned for him to read and he began. He read until the end of verse 10 and I spoke up.\n\n\"Poor Joseph,\" I said. This frequently quoted verse always made me feel bad for him. \"The last thing I would want to be told in my pain and suffering was that I should just deal, because someone else had it much worse. There is always someone who has it worse, but that doesn't change that you are still hurting.\"\n\nMark looked at me, carefully listening to what I was saying. He more intently leaned over his scriptures and said with enthusiasm, \"But Megan, you have missed verse 7.\" I quickly reread the verse and looked puzzled up at him. He read it out loud and then commented. \"See it says 'My son, peace be unto thy soul'.\"\n\nHearing the word peace spoken with the emphasis that Mark placed upon it, I finally understood. In all my years of hearing this scripture, I had given it the most mundane meaning. I had assumed it was Heavenly Father's way of calming down Joseph so that he could talk; the same way a parent might say 'listen'. But my understanding changed with that one word. When the Lord offers peace it is very real and Joseph must have received some instant comfort from the Holy Ghost. Tears filled my eyes as I saw God's love and power in that simple line. I tried not to look up into Mark's waiting face. \"Oh, I get it,\" I softly said.\n\nWe continued to read on, but I still felt awed by this personal revelation. I was having my own moment of peace and the feelings of God's love were almost overwhelming.\n\nMy reflective moments came to a stop as we heard the family noisily ascending the stairs. The movie must be over. We hastily finished the last couple of verses and he put his scriptures away. Before I closed mine, I took my red pencil and highlighted verse 7. The family walked into the kitchen just as I was zipping up my case. \"There you two are,\" came the booming voice of Brother Cole. \"Want to join us for root beer floats?\"\n\nBroad smiles spread across our faces and we nodded our heads. I said, \"That sounds great! They're my favorite.\" Reaching in to turn off the lamp, my hand met Mark's under the shade. He apparently had the same impulse. He moved his hand aside to allow me to turn the switch and gently ran his finger over the back of my hand. My heart jumped and I felt heat rising in my face. We looked at each other for a moment before the voice of Sister Cole interrupted.\n\n\"Mark, could you help me with Micah?\" He jumped up to get his brother and I was relieved to be able to breathe normally again.\n\n* * *\n\nThe loud, friendly, familiar sounds of family surrounded the big wooden table in the dining area. Rebekah had emerged from her room without the phone attached to her ear and the family was complete. I stared around at the faces that had become so dear to me. Each was very different in its appearance, yet they all seemed like they belonged. When I looked at the Coles, I saw family.\n\nMark was trying to include Micah in the fun even though he couldn't partake of the floats. A look on the boy's face as his eyes darted back and forth following the boisterous sounds of the joking conversation. I knew he was seeing what I saw. A warm feeling started to fill me. The peaceful feelings returned and I had to excuse myself for a moment. I went into Rebekah's room and knelt to thank Heavenly Father for the Coles and for the peace of the Spirit.\n\nWhen I returned, Brother Cole had just flung his root beer foam at the unsuspecting Christian. It was clear, war was about to break out when Sister Cole piped up with a timely, \"Bedtime.\" The sounds of disappointment rang through the room, as a smile curled on her lips. Brother Cole led the family prayer and then Sister Cole put her arms around Anna and Ruth. \"Come on girls, you have school tomorrow.\"\n\nThey walked off toward the hall. Mark began the process of getting Micah to his room. Since he had been home, Mark had resumed his routine of singing to Micah every night before bed. Sometimes if things had quieted down enough, I could hear the simple Primary melodies and hymns carrying through the house. Sometimes I even stood outside the door to listen.\n\nCaleb finished in the bathroom and I went in to brush my teeth. On my way out, I ran into Mark who was placing the bulky wheelchair in the entryway where it would stay for the night. He touched me lightly on the arm as he headed back to the boys room. Pausing, he said, \"Don't go to bed yet.\"\n\nHe looked so serious, but as he walked through the door, he was all smiles and jokes. I lingered in the hall a few moments to hear him sing. He started with 'Love is spoken here.' I quietly sang the second verse, my favorite, with him. I hoped no one heard. Then, I drifted back to the dining area to start cleaning up. Christian and Brother Cole had already made a big dent in the mess.\n\nI walked into the kitchen with a glass in each hand, just in time to catch a splash of water coming from the sink's spray nozzle aimed at Brother Cole. Christian straightened up quickly and apologized, looking rather guilty.\n\nNormally as a guest in someone's home, I would never dream of retaliating, but ... the Coles were beginning to feel like family. I calmly walked over and placed the glasses in the sink. Christian moved out of my way still acting a bit sheepish. Brother Cole had gone quiet and was busy wiping down the counter, he seemed to feel a bit guilty too. This would be my chance to catch them off guard.\n\nIn one motion, I grabbed the spray nozzle, spun around, and squirted Christian before he could react. Brother Cole burst out with a laugh and Christian grabbed my arm trying to aim the spray at me. We were laughing and spraying water everywhere.\n\nWhen Mark walked in, Christian was behind me with his arms around me trying to grab the hose. I was trying my best to keep it from him, but the boy was strong. I had at least stopped the water flow so that the mess wouldn't get any worse. Mark raised an eyebrow in my direction and it was my turn to look sheepish. Sister Cole walked in behind Mark and went out again. She was probably upset by the mess. I should have followed my manners lessons after all.\n\n\"No, Christian. You are doing it all wrong,\" Mark said, rushing toward the nozzle. Before I figured out what was happening, I was beaten. There was no hope when they combined against me. It reminded me of the twins; that was one of their favorite tactics. Sister Cole returned with towels and a smirk on her face. Thankfully, she didn't seem upset. We each got a towel and started to clean up our mess. Brother Cole was rescued from the scene by Sister Cole grabbing his hand. She stretched up to kiss his cheek and led him from the room.\n\nDown on our hands and knees mopping up the water, I looked up from my task to find Mark looking at me. I stuck my tongue out at him and he grinned. Christian kept trying to swat me and Mark with his wet towel. Mark gave him an authoritative glare and Christian stopped.\n\nWhen the mess was mopped up, Mark sent Christian packing with a promise that he would play a game of one on one with him Saturday morning. \"I thought we could take a walk?\" He said it in a tone of asking permission. Looking down at my soaked clothes, I debated, but it was a nice night and I really wanted to go.\n\n\"Sure, I can't think of a better way to dry off.\" With that, he grabbed my hand, pulled me up from the floor, and we went to the entry to put on our shoes. Mine were at the bottom of the pile. Were there really that many feet in this house?\n\n\"Back later,\" he called to his parents who were snuggling on the living room couch. He guided me out the front door with his hand on the small of my back. I felt a burst of joy to feel it there and I tried to check myself. This was one thing that hadn't gotten easier since I had come to the Coles. Now more than ever I craved Mark's company.\n\nThe sun was starting to set and the rural street wasn't really well lit. I began to wonder if this was such a good idea. Mark closed the door and came up behind me. He slipped his hand into mine. I liked it so much, I gave up fighting it for the moment. Looking up into his face, I saw a question, 'Is this okay?' I gave him a genuine smile and hoped I knew what I was doing.\n\nWe walked for a while in silence. Then he sighed. \"So work was tough? What happened? Want to talk about it?\" I asked, curious about his mood and to find out what had made him decide to be so affectionate. Work seemed like a good place to start.\n\n\"One of the men I take care of is dying.\" My shoulders hunched as he spoke. \"He has been sick for a long time. His family has started coming from all over to say their last goodbyes. I guess talking to him and his family has just made me a little melancholy. It is just so sad, the wasted time. Do you know that some of them haven't seen him for ten years?\"\n\n\"I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?\" I was anxious to help him as he had always helped me.\n\n\"It just made me think. I'm great now.\" He squeezed my hand. \"Scripture study with you was just what I needed.\"\n\n\"I needed it too. You helped me understand better.\"\n\nHe opened his mouth to say something then closed it again, changing his mind. The mood was so serious and I was in danger of snuggling into his arm, so to lighten it, I poked him in the ribs and blurted out, \"What?\"\n\nHe took the bait and I started to run away to escape his reaching hands. His long legs caught me, a little faster than I expected, and he pulled me close to him in a hug. I was out of breath and confused. Nothing had ever felt so wonderful, and yet my old problems were still there.\n\n\"You really shouldn't run down a country road in the dark,\" he said, in a mock seriousness and then his voice changed. \"And you should never run away from me.\"\n\nI shook my head, sad that this wonderful moment had to end so soon. \"It sounds wonderful, but it won't work. I couldn't ask you to give up....\" I trailed off, fighting back tears, defeated. I tried to pull myself away from him, my head down. I'd been fooling myself; this wasn't getting any easier. It was always going to hurt.\n\nHe held me tightly in his grasp. \"What's this? I thought you were finally understanding.\" With his hand, he lifted my chin so that he could look into my eyes, but I couldn't meet his gaze. There was so much I wanted, and sadly, so much that I couldn't have.\n\nHe continued, \"Okay, that's it.\" He dragged me off the road and sat me down under a nearby tree. Sitting himself beside me, he huffed. \"Andy is my friend, but frankly he is an idiot.\" My eyes went wide. What was he saying?\n\n\"I don't understand.\" I had never heard Mark say a bad word about anyone, especially his best friend.\n\nHe reached across and grabbed my hands. \"I have wanted to say that for a long time,\" he said with a sigh. \"You are so great, anyone who would let you go is... well, an idiot.\"\n\n\"But Andy was right. It isn't fair to ask anyone to give up children for me.\"\n\n\"Megan, did my parents give anything up?\" he asked me in a frustrated tone.\n\n\"Your family is wonderful. I love being here with them, but that doesn't change the fact that...\" I started to protest. He reached up and stopped my lips with his fingers.\n\n\"My parents have built a family differently than most, but that doesn't make it any less precious. I tend to think that is makes it more precious. Where would I, or any of my brothers and sisters, be without them? They have given us a family for eternity. I could pick this life in a heartbeat. Could you?\"\n\nSwallowing hard, I tried to think about how I really felt. Something had been changing in me for some time. Something had been...healing. I knew that healing had come from the Lord and his answers. He answered me through Christy, Mr. Wallace, my dad and this wonderful family. Was Mark really offering me acceptance? Did I dare let go of the walls that had been building this year and let myself be loved? I cried while Mark stroked the back of my hand and waited for me to get it all out.\n\n\"I love you, Megan,\" he said in an almost whisper. \"It has been painful to watch your light go out. But I am sure that I see it lit again and getting brighter. Please let me be there to watch you glow again.\"\n\nMy crying redoubled, but I was smiling through my tears. He drew me in close to him and I cried on his shoulder, leaving a huge wet spot on his shirt. Pulling my face away with an apologetic look I said, \"Sorry about your shirt.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know you were just trying to get back at me for the water fight in the kitchen,\" he said with a grin.\n\nHe was good at making me laugh and I wiped the tears off my face. He reached out and grabbed my chin in his hand again. This time he pulled my face closer to his and gently his lips touched mine. My shoulder relaxed and I nearly melted into a gooey puddle on the ground.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said, hoping that he would hear all the meaning behind those simple words. My soul sighed in contentment, as I shook off the terror of being lonely that had haunted me. Maybe it didn't have to be that way.\n\nWe walked home hand in hand and I worked hard at wiping my swollen eyes clear. Hopefully Mark's parents wouldn't still be in the living room when we entered. The porch light was welcoming us home. I was sure that once we were in the bright light again, I would look a mess and he would look as wet as I still was from the kitchen battle.\n\nHe stopped me just before we reached the halo of light that emanated from the porch. Facing me, he reached up and brushed my hair where it had fallen on my face. Then he leaned in and kissed me just as gently as before. This time I wasn't surprised and I threw my arms around his neck and kissed him back. \"You snuck up on me again,\" I whispered.\n\nHe smiled, \"It's all about timing and patience.\"\n\nWhen we walked in it wasn't late, but the living room was empty. Sister Cole still had one more day of seminary. Reluctantly we said goodnight. Things may be new and different, but tomorrow we still had to go to work.\n\nTrying to be quiet, I climbed into my sleeping bag on the floor. \"You really like Mark, don't you?\" Rebekah wasn't asleep yet.\n\nI laid there all tucked in and wondered how to respond. I brushed my lips with my fingers, smiling. \"I like him very much.\"\n\n\"Good!\" Rebekah said with a yawn.\n\nIt was a while before I fell asleep. My mind wouldn't settle down. I was busy thinking about healing, peace, acceptance, love, and Mark.\nChapter 17\n\nI spent all day Friday trying to shake the warm fuzzies from my head. It wasn't because they weren't pleasant, but because a distracted swim instructor is not a good thing. At least it was a free swim day for the kids, so I didn't need to give any instructions. I made it through work without any disasters and I rode my bike back to the Coles.\n\nI was free now to dream about my knight. At first, I thought that this all started yesterday or maybe even a week ago. But the more I thought of Mark, the more my heart warmed with memories and the more the feelings of peace returned. My suspicions also increased as I reviewed those memories. Had he been trying to tell me for a long time how he felt?\n\nI was practically floating through the house at dinner; good thing that Mark was at work, because I wasn't brave enough to face the reality of my feelings just yet. This way I got to enjoy just the idea of being wanted; and not only wanted, but wanted by someone so amazing, someone I wanted, too.\n\nMark's family was polite, but they all looked at me as if I was crazy when they saw what must have been a delirious look on my face and the way I was moving in a fog. It didn't help that they had to repeat everything to me. I tried a little harder after dinner to be part of the conversation, but the Coles had stopped trying to talk to me.\n\nTaking the trash out gave me a chance to be alone and compose myself before Mark made it home. While I was outside, I climbed a nearby apple tree and curled up in the limbs. In the quiet of that moment, it was nice to sit and considered my blessings. How had I gotten here? My life felt like a paint by numbers that I had thought was a jumbled mess until Heavenly Father put the last few colors in to reveal a beautiful picture. Surely, I hadn't been moving towards this point since I was 16. But in this moment, everything fit together so perfectly that I wasn't sure.\n\nI prayed again with so much gratitude in my heart. For the first time in a long time, I knew that Heavenly Father was looking out for me and guiding me with his hand. Then remorse came for the dark thoughts that had driven my depression this winter. Dark was right, I had pushed the light right out of my life. I pleaded for the forgiving power of my Savior. As I did, I was completely filled up with light. I thanked Heavenly Father for the gift of forgiveness and sat in the tree appreciating the warmth of that light.\n\nMark's truck pulled into the drive. I stayed where I was, like a coward, and let him go inside. He came out a few minutes later and stood on the porch looking around. Realizing that he was looking for me, I felt embarrassed. My cowardly state became more pronounced as I hid among the foliage. When he went back inside, I took a deep breath, climbed out of the tree and sneaked around to the back of the house. He saw me as he came to the sliding glass door heading out to look for me. \"Hi, you're home,\" I said brightly, but feeling devious.\n\n\"Yeah, are you okay? I was looking for you. They said you've been gone for a while.\"\n\n\"I'm fine,\" I said and because I hated to lie, \"I was in the apple tree enjoying some quiet time.\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't see you.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I said lowering my eyes, \"I was hiding.\"\n\n\"Hiding? From me?\" I watched his eyes turn sad.\n\nWanting to make it better, I explained, \"Not exactly, I just wasn't ready to talk to anyone yet. I've been working some things out.\" He seemed to understand and his face relaxed. \"Scriptures?\" I asked, hoping that he would know that time with him was important.\n\n\"Scriptures,\" he agreed. \"Just let me get changed.\"\n\n* * *\n\nThe next day was Saturday and it was not the happiest day in the Cole house. The long week had left the younger kids cranky. Ruth had cried and carried on when Sister Cole had taken Anna shopping instead of her. Brother Cole had taken the boys out into the garage for some woodworking. Christian grumbled as they went.\n\nMark spent the morning trying to cheer Micah up, but he just whimpered and cried. Sitting next to them, I offered assistance where I could. Mark took Micah to his room for a few minutes to change him and make sure he wasn't in physical discomfort. When they returned, I joined Mark in singing to Micah. Then I read him a story. He really liked the pictures in If You Give a Mouse a Cookie. Ruth seemed to like that one too. She moved into the room from where she was hiding in the kitchen. I welcomed her over by holding out my arm and she snuggled in on my lap. Mark went into the kitchen to prepare a formula feeding for Micah while I read Ruth another story. Nervously, I watched Mark expose the feeding tube and wait for the formula to drain. It wasn't as bad as I expected and Mark was so gentle whenever he cared for Micah.\n\nThe feeding hadn't calmed Micah as we'd hoped, so we went back to singing. Mark showed me how to rub some of the tension out of Micah's arms and I helped as we sang. After three or four songs, I looked up to see Christian in the sliding glass doorway. He was covered in sawdust and looking expectantly at Mark. \"Ready,\" he asked, hopefully.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Christian. I can't right now,\" he said, looking from Christian to Micah as if to indicate what was holding him up.\n\n\"What's the matter Micah?\" Christian said, coming in the door and heading for his little brother. \"Having a bad day?\" It moved me that even this self-absorbed teen could be so loving to his brother.\n\n\"You don't have to postpone your game,\" I said, feeling brave. \"Ruth and I will keep Micah entertained. Won't we, Micah?\"\n\nMark studied me. \"Are you sure?\"\n\nI gave him a gentle shove. \"You promised,\" I reminded him. He and Christian jumped up and were out the door in a flash. I could hear them starting to tease each other as they headed for the court.\n\nRuth produced a large pile of picture books and we began to read. Occasionally, I could hear the happy sounds of the brotherly competition on the court. After the fourth book, I looked over to find that Micah had fallen asleep. I moved Ruth from my lap and she ran off to play. I called out the back door, \"Mark, Micah fell asleep, should we move him to his bed?\"\n\n\"I've got it,\" he waved. \"We're done here.\" He tossed the ball at Christian and started toward the house.\n\n\"Next time you're going down!\" Christian taunted.\n\nBefore going to Micah, Mark walked straight to me, kissed me firmly, backed away, and smiled. His smiles made me feel dizzy and very happy. I needed to find some way to score them differently in my totals.\n\nHe pushed Micah's chair through the kitchen towards the hall. I followed him, stopping in the kitchen briefly for a glass of water. All that reading had made me thirsty. Mark was backing out of the boys' room and closing the door before I had even reached the hall. He walked up to me and grabbed my hand as we turned to go and enjoy the beautiful morning outside.\n\n\"You're wonderful,\" he whispered, kissing my cheek. I blushed under his touch and praise. \"It makes me feel so happy to see the way you care about Micah; about all of my brothers and sisters.\"\n\n\"Why wouldn't I?\" Spying a basketball, I scooped it up and ran towards the court. I hollered over my shoulder, \"How about a game?\" His response was a swift sprint to the court after me.\n\n\"Okay, first person to ten wins,\" I explained.\n\n\"What do they win?\" he inquired, looking very interested.\n\n\"If I win I get another kiss and if you win I will tell you a secret.\"\n\n\"Tough choice,\" he complained.\n\n\"Then I guess you had better play your best and just see what happens.\"\n\nTo say that we were evenly matched would be a gross overstatement, but I did manage to hold my own for the first few shots. I suspected that he was just being careful not to foul me, but I used the advantage willingly. He started to see that I was getting too far ahead and I didn't touch the ball for a few baskets while he caught up. I decided to play a little ruthlessly hoping to keep the game even. \"Fouls don't count!\" I called, as I traveled shamelessly. He caught on quickly grabbing me around the waist and turning me just as I got my shot off. Unfortunately, the ball didn't go in and the score stood at six all.\n\nIt was Mark's turn with the ball, and I made sure that the fouls kept coming. I yanked at his arms and pulled at the ball with enough force that I pulled it away. Another basket for me, and the score stood at eight to six. Mark was faster this time and charged the basket before I could get in the way; a simple lay-up and the score stood at eight all. It was my turn with the ball and I lost it quickly now that Mark knew how dirty I played. He was just going up for a basket when I got in front of him to block.\n\nI suddenly saw a way that we could both win. Just as he raised his arms for a basket I jumped up, kissed his nose and smiling said, \"I love you, Mark.\" He dropped the ball and stared at me trying to decide if I was serious or not. Taking the advantage my timely secret had just given me, I scooped the ball up, turned and shot. \"I win, where is my kiss?\" I said, almost laughing.\n\nMark was tongue tied and stunned. Still staring, he searched my face for any kind of denial, but I trust he found none. \"Really?\" was all he could get out and even that sounded a bit too husky for him.\n\n\"Yes, I love you so much.\" I got my kiss then.\n\n\"I feel like celebrating,\" Mark said as he grabbed my waist and spun me around before pulling me into a bear hug. \"Oh, I'm sorry. I promised my parents I would babysit tonight while they chaperone the stake dance. We will have to settle for a rented movie, I guess.\"\n\n\"That's okay. I don't mind as long as we are together.\" It was getting easier to see myself happy and together with Mark.\n\n\"Hey, Mark. Dad wants you.\" It was Christian calling from the garage.\n\nWe walked hand in hand to the garage back door. I couldn't help looking up at him and enjoying the bewildered smile on his face. We entered the woodworking shop. Having never been in there, I was surprised at how extensive it was; large power tools filled one half of the two car garage.\n\n\"Oh, good, Mark. I need you to do some gluing for me. Christian just finished the carving.\" Brother Cole was dressed in some denim coveralls and his head was beaded with sweat. \"Hi, Megan,\" he added when he looked up and saw me.\n\n\"What are you guys making?\" I looked around curiously at the piles of lumber and the various saws and power tools. I was definitely out of my depths in here. But the smell was incredible. I inhaled deeply; it reminded me of the woods.\n\n\"Hope chests,\" Brother Cole answered, handing the pieces to Mark and showing him where they were to go on the plain wooded box standing on some newspaper.\n\n\"Do people still make those?\" I asked, surprised.\n\n\"Dad does,\" Mark said, smiling up at his father.\n\n\"You can never have too much hope,\" Brother Cole said. Mark mouthed the words at the same time, as if this were a practiced ritual.\n\n\"Wow, those carvings are really amazing,\" I said, noticing the intricate scroll work that Mark now held in his hands.\n\n\"Yeah, Christian has a knack. Mark tried his hand at carving but his results were... well let's just say we found that he is definitely our best gluer.\" Brother Cole smiled broadly and ducked as a shop rag flew from Marks vicinity towards his head.\n\n\"Thanks, Dad.\"\n\n\"Who are the hope chests for?\" The guys had been out in the workshop quite a bit in the last couple of weeks, and it looked like there were several in progress.\n\n\"This one is Rebekah's,\" Mark said as he carefully placed the gluey pieces in the chosen spots. \"We are almost done with it.\"\n\n\"We figured we may as well get started on Anna's and Ruth's while we're at it,\" Brother Cole added.\n\n\"The carvings on Anna's are taking a really long time. Christian wants them to be just right.\" It was the first time that I had noticed Caleb sitting on the ground in the corner sanding something.\n\n\"Oh, hi Caleb, I didn't see you there.\"\n\n\"Dad's got me doing what he calls the grunt work today,\" he said with shining eyes.\n\nAn idea had been brewing in my head for a few minutes, and I thought that Caleb might be just the person to help me with it. \"Are you going to be busy for a while?\" I asked Mark.\n\nHe sighed, \"I think so. There are lots of little pieces here.\"\n\n\"Good.\" I smiled a little as his face fall. \"I mean, I have a couple of errands to run. Brother Cole, can I borrow Caleb?\"\n\n\"Sure, he's worked hard. An afternoon with a lovely lady would be just right.\" Brother Cole winked at me and Caleb jumped up dusting sawdust off.\n\nI walked a couple of steps forward and I placed a kiss on Mark's forehead. It earned me a sunny smile from him and a cocked eyebrow from Brother Cole. \"You should open up the garage door,\" I suggested. \"That glue smells strong.\"\n\nCaleb and I exited the workshop. It was time to fill him in on my plan. When we reached the house, Caleb went downstairs to get a few things from Mark's room. I went straight to Rebekah's room to get my purse. Rebekah was in a crabby mood today because she was writing a paper she had put off until the last minute. I tried to get my things quickly and then give her some space. Sister Cole and Anna were not home yet from shopping so the house was quiet as I fumbled around looking for Mark's keys. I found them under the heap of papers on the table. Yelling down to Caleb that I would meet him at the truck, I headed back to the garage. I overheard Mark and his dad talking as I neared the garage. \"That's great son, how do you want to handle it?\"\n\nThere was a pause and then Mark's voice sighed, \"I guess I will break in the new tent.\"\n\n\"Okay, I will help you set it up in a little while.\" Brother Cole was grinning as I entered the garage, carrying my purse and Mark's keys.\n\nMark's head popped up from his gluing work. \"Hi,\" I said. \"Mark could I borrow your truck for a little while?\"\n\n\"Sure, do you want me to go with you?\" There was so much hope in his voice. It felt nice.\n\n\"No, you finish up here. We won't be long.\" Then as an afterthought, I turned to Brother Cole. \"Caleb's coming too, okay?\"\n\n\"Sure, like I said he's earned it. Was Micah up yet?\" He asked as he put away some of his tools.\n\n\"Not that I could tell. All was quiet.\"\n\n\"Well, I had better head into the house, anyway. I have chores to do before Rachel gets home. You know how she can get when I spend too much time in the workshop,\" he said to Mark. Dusting himself off, he walked out the now open large garage door.\n\nI waved to Mark and followed through the door to where the truck was parked. Caleb was already there waiting for me. It took me a minute to review in my head where all the gears were and then we backed out for our errands. I reached the end of the driveway and was putting the car into first gear when I looked up and saw Mark in the garage doorway. I waved again and he returned it.\n\nIt didn't take long for Caleb and me to find what we were looking for. With few store selections, we settled on a dollar store that turned out to have everything we needed. Caleb pushed the cart as I filled it up with chips, cookies and balloons; even finding some fun flashlights for the little girls to use on the camping trip. I grabbed a few personal items I was running low on; hair scrunchies were at the top of the list \u2013 I always managed to lose them somehow. For a moment, I pictured what would happen when I had gone home to Arizona in a couple of weeks. Surely, the Coles would be finding my hair accessories for months.\n\nThe thought of leaving made me sad. I would miss the Coles, but mostly I would miss Mark. What would happen to us when we were so far apart? Would it prove just an infatuation? Could I bear to avoid someone else at school out of awkwardness? Shaking the thoughts from my mind, I remembered that I was planning a celebration. A celebration of the way Mark and I felt about each other. I knew it was love.\n\nCaleb looked at me appalled, as I wiped a tear quickly from my cheek. \"Did I do something wrong? Oh, man, Mark is going to kill me!\"\n\nHis honest and hastily spoken words made me laugh. \"I'm fine,\" I assured him. \"Let's go buy ourselves a candy bar for all our hard work today.\" Caleb seemed delighted by the offer and we spent several minutes on that isle picking from all the choices.\n\nOn the way home, Caleb told me all about school and his friend Jackson. This friend had just reached the highest level on some console game that I was unfamiliar with, but that Caleb described in detail. I reflected that, if I were home, the twins would probably have filled me in on the details by now too. He became more animated as he got more into his story. Apparently, I had been wrong about Caleb, assuming he was very reserved. He was just a little shy. Now that he knew me a little better, it was clear that getting him to stop talking would be the trick. It was easy to ask him questions as he filled the time driving back.\n\nAs we neared the house, I was anxious to see Mark again. I hadn't completely shaken off my earlier sadness and I needed a hug. I pulled into the driveway next to the large passenger van. Sister Cole and Anna were back from shopping. \"Let's get inside, they probably need help unloading the groceries. We can meet secretly later to decorate.\"\n\nFeeling conspiratorial, we left our things in the truck and hurried in. The kitchen was definitely buzzing with bags being unpacked and various cupboards flying open randomly, or at least it seemed that way to me. Mark was not in the middle of this unloading party and that surprised me; he was usually so helpful.\n\nIn the few weeks I had been here, I hadn't spent much time digging through the cupboards so I wasn't likely to be much help. Sister Cole however found a task for me. \"Oh, good, Megan. Could I ask you to take some things downstairs to the storeroom?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said with enthusiasm, happy to help.\n\nShe gestured toward the pile that was growing in the dining room near the stairs. Grabbing my first load of paper towels and a gallon of vegetable oil, I headed down into the basement. I paused at the bottom of the stairs to fumble for the light. Mark wasn't down here either. He must still be working in the garage. Several trips later, I had most things in the right place. The storeroom was full of shelves, but everything was easy to see. I noticed a clipboard with an inventory list hanging on the wall near the door. Grabbing the pencil that hung off the clip, I filled in the new items. I had taken inventory before at work and this didn't seem too difficult. I double checked the numbers on the items that I had altered just to make sure I had done it right. Then, I replaced the clipboard and went upstairs.\n\nThings had settled down in the kitchen; most everything had been put away. Sister Cole had bread and peanut butter out on the counter. She was grabbing the jelly from the refrigerator. I washed my hands and fetched a couple of table knives. The mass production of sandwiches for our late lunch began and Sister Cole casually asked, \"So, what is going on with you and Mark these days?\"\n\nYikes, what do I say? Everything was so new. I gulped, \"I'm not sure. I really like him, and I think he really likes me too.\" I hoped Sister Cole would be okay with this new development.\n\nSister Cole's mouth bent into a smile, \"Yes, I would say that he likes you very much and has for quite a while.\"\n\nWhat? Did Mark talk to his parents about me? Of course he did. He tells his family everything. I couldn't manage to say anything but \"Oh.\"\n\n\"He has been worried about you, you know?\" she continued. \"It is hard to watch someone you love in pain. Our whole family has been praying for you for months.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said almost inaudibly. \"I didn't realize so many people cared about me.\"\n\n\"We never do when we are hurting. That is part of Satan's plan. He's very good at making us feel alone.\"\n\n\"I'm beginning to see that. The weird thing is that I thought it was all me, that they were my thoughts.\"\n\n\"When we let discouragement win, Satan wins.\"\n\n\"I'm very lucky to have your family and especially Mark in my life or I might still be in darkness.\"\n\n\"Do you love him?\"\n\nShe had used the word 'love' \u2013 I had been avoiding it thinking that she would think my feelings sudden and not real. But they weren't sudden, I told myself. I had liked Mark from the beginning; I just hadn't seen him that way, not until recently, and then it was impossible with my problems for it to work. But he wanted me anyway, and I was daring to hope. I felt overwhelmed but shook my head 'yes' and asked, \"Where is Mark?\"\n\nSister Cole gazed toward the kitchen window that overlooked the backyard. I looked to and saw Mark and his Dad wrestling with a large tent. It seemed to be winning. Seeing my mouth open, part in humor, part in surprise, Sister Cole said, \"I can finish up here, why don't you go and see if you can give them a hand.\" I nodded and made my exit.\n\nOut on the patio, Micah sat facing the fumbling men. Walking up to him, I crouched beside his chair. \"They look pretty silly, don't they?\" I was biting my lip to control my laugh as Mark poked his head out of a hole in the fabric, looking pleased to see me. In a louder voice I asked, \"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"Airing out the tent,\" Mark replied then looked pointedly at his father. I remembered then that they had said something about the tent earlier.\n\n\"Can I help? Looks like you need some.\" I let a giggle escape my lips. Brother Cole looked up from some folded instructions, seeming relieved by the offer.\n\nMark stubbornly pouted, \"We've got it. I was a Boy Scout. I can put up a simple tent.\"\n\nI stepped over anyway and grabbed a pole. \"Extra hands will just help it go faster,\" I soothed. The tent was indeed not a simple one, but eventually it stood on its own. \"It was a good idea to practice with this before the trip next week. It should be easier the next time.\"\n\nBrother Cole took Micah inside for lunch. Mark and I stood admiring our work. He held out his hand to me. I took it and then reached out for the hug I had been wanting. I couldn't help it, I cried a little on his shoulder and he squeezed me tighter waiting for me to speak. \"What's wrong?\" he asked after a long time.\n\nI just shook my head. I didn't want to tell him that I was afraid to leave, afraid that everything would go away and I would be all alone again. He pushed me out gently and then wiped my tears with his hands. \"Like my new place?\" he asked with a wry smile, trying to distract me.\n\nThe puzzled expression on my face launched him into an explanation, \"Mom and Dad think that since we are together now, it would not be appropriate for us to stay in the same house. I have my choice of the tent or the Putnam's down the street. The tent is closer.\" He grinned at this last statement then added, \"I guess I can see their point, you are a beautiful temptation.\" He brushed the length of my nose with his finger, playfully.\n\nToo horrified to take in the compliment, I blurted out, \"I'm sorry. You should get to stay in your own house; you shouldn't be exiled just because of me. I'll take the tent.\"\n\n\"Not just because of you; because of us,\" he emphasized, interrupting my rant. He laughed, \"Besides the boys are in the house now deciding who gets to sleep out here with me on which nights. If you took the tent they would be crushed.\"\n\n\"I'm still sorry, it doesn't seem fair,\" I sighed, quietly distracted by how nice it had sounded when he said the word 'us'.\n\nHe hugged me again. \"Don't you see \u2013 this is a good thing. This exile, as you put it, is just another reminder that I have you.\" Kissing my forehead he added, \"Do me a favor?\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I agreed.\n\n\"Smile,\" he said, touching the corners of my mouth with his index finger. I obliged him. \"Thank you, now how shall we spend the rest of the day?\"\n\nI shrugged, feeling content to be in his arms, but he let me go and grabbed my hand instead. He headed toward the basketball court so I prepared myself for a rematch as he scooped up the ball. \"Do you mind another trip into town? I need to buy the family a new basketball.\"\n\nI looked at the ball for any visible signs of damage, but found none. \"Why?\"\n\nTucking the ball under his arm and steering me toward the house, he replied, \"Because I am keeping this one. It has some good memories attached to it now.\" Again, I felt warm with love and a bit worried by my growing need for that love.\nChapter 18\n\nWe were driving down the road I had just taken with Caleb as we ate our sandwiches. \"Okay, suppose you tell me now why you were crying earlier.\"\n\nEmbarrassment washed over me. I wasn't sure I wanted him to know what I was feeling or even if it could be put into words. I decided on the simplest explanation. \"I'm sorry, I feel like I have been crying a lot lately.\"\n\nHe couldn't help but interrupt, \"You've had a lot to think about, don't be so hard on yourself.\" Then in a teasing tone, he added, \"I've got sisters, tears are just a girl thing, right?\" I glared at him, but the grin on his face reduced me to a laugh. \"I'm sorry, go on,\" he urged.\n\n\"I was just thinking about going home after the camping trip.\"\n\n\"Oh, are you homesick? I didn't realize, I guess you miss your family.\"\n\n\"No!\" I almost shouted. \"I mean yes...but I was crying because I was thinking about having to leave you.\" There, I said it and I couldn't take it back. I sat looking at my hands in my lap.\n\n\"I've thought of that too,\" he said. \"It will only be for six weeks. I was thinking I might rearrange my work days and come for a visit.\"\n\n\"But what if...\" I started to cry. \"What if you decide you don't want me anymore?\" I felt really stupid now. How did I become one of those girls that was so needy? Had one bad relationship shaken me so much? Or was it that I felt completely unprepared for the strong feelings I was having?\n\nLost in thought, I didn't even realize that we were parked in front of the store. There were people walking to and from their cars. Great, now I was crying in public. Mark reached across the seat and grabbed my hand, squeezing it tight. He waited until I looked up at him. \"I am not going anywhere. I love you, remember. Distance is not going to change that. It's just going to make it a lot harder to do this.\" He bent and kissed the hand that he was holding. \"Trust me. I am not going anywhere, like a pet goldfish. I am not leaving you.\"\n\nCheered, I scooted over next to him and he held me while I wiped my face and waited for the red blotches to go away. He stroked my cheek. I was calm once again and thinking now about his visit to Arizona.\n\nI sat up suddenly, \"It would be so great if you could visit. There are so many things I want to show you. Oh, and you have to meet my family. Have you ever been to Arizona before? There is this fun ghost town with a working mine not too far from my house, and the Mesa temple, and there is a great dry riverbed I know of that has the coolest rocks, to bad I can't show Ruth that....\" I took a much needed breath and Mark laughed at me.\n\n\"Your moods could give me whiplash,\" he said, shaking his head. \"But I hope this means you believe me about how much I love you.\"\n\nI nodded, \"Sorry, it takes time, but it is starting to sink in.\" I kissed his cheek, then scooted back to my side of the truck so that we could go shopping. He went around the truck and opened my door, as he always did. Locking my arm in his, I said, \"Let's go shopping, my sweet goldfish.\" I smiled at my new endearment and he rolled his eyes.\n\n\"Okay how about a deal. I'll let you call me Marky if you don't call me that again.\" The look of playful anxiety on his face was priceless. I leaned into his shoulder and giggled.\n\nOne basketball and a red rose later we were sitting in the truck again. I was appreciating the subtle smell of this beautiful gift when he surprised me. \"I think that I am going to cancel the backpacking trip with Christian.\"\n\n\"What? Why?\" This was confusing; he had campaigned so much for that part of the trip when we were making the plans. It was a chance to do something special with his brother and they had both being looking forward to it.\n\nHe hung his head a little and then looked out his side window checking his mirror as he backed up. \"Two days is a long time, we only have so much time before you have to go home. I don't want to waste it.\"\n\nImmediately I saw what he meant and felt the same, but I couldn't let him cancel his plans. \"Christian would be so crushed. You need to go, you will have fun and I will be right in camp waiting for you when you get back.\"\n\n\"But,\" he paused, \"I wish you could come.\"\n\nI sighed. This had been my wish, too, from the beginning. I loved backpacking. I'd had so much fun helping them plan it. I had been on that trail once and it was really beautiful. Now I wished to go mostly to be with him, but we had decided weeks ago that it would not be appropriate without proper chaperones.\n\n\"It will be okay, have fun with Christian. You never know when it will be your last chance. My trip with George last year turned out to be our last. That's when he told me he was getting married.\" I blushed, realizing what my words might imply. I quickly added, \"After all Christian will be going on a mission in another year or so.\"\n\n\"True,\" he said. \"Things seem to change quickly the older we get.\" He pulled into the driveway and said, \"I wonder who I am rooming with tonight?\"\n\nI was suddenly wishing that I had been there for that argument. \"I hope its Caleb. He was a big help today.\"\n\n\"That reminds me. What is this surprise of yours?\" he asked, flashing me a hopeful smile.\n\n\"If you haven't figured it out, you will just have to wait and see.\"\n\n\"Figured it out? I'm not that with it. As far as I am concerned you are full of surprises.\"\n\n\"Yeah, like crazy crying jags,\" I said, shaking my head.\n\n\"Don't be embarrassed. Feelings just happen sometimes. How do you think I felt realizing that I was falling for the girl my best friend liked? And then when you kissed me... talk about seriously breaking the guy code.\"\n\nI laughed, \"Oh, yes, the infamous guy code. How did you get past that?\"\n\n\"It got easier when I saw you hurting and he was the cause. Somehow, I felt less friendly toward him.\"\n\nHis confession made me feel guilty. \"But he's your best friend. You can't stay mad at him. It wasn't his fault that he wanted something I couldn't give. It is better that he left earlier than later.\" I thought back to that time. It had hurt when he left, but not because I was in love. The feelings I felt for Mark were so much stronger and different from those I had for Andy.\n\n\"No, I can't stay mad at him, you're right. In fact, someday I need to remember to thank him.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"Being an idiot. I could never have stolen you away from him.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that, you can be incredibly endearing and persuasive.\" I took another sniff of my rose.\n\n\"And cute, don't forget cute.\"\n\n\"Cute doesn't begin to cover it. You are dashing inside and out.\" He actually blushed. I liked that. He should feel as good as I did.\n\nAs we got out of the car, I snuggled into his chest. \"Scriptures tonight?\" he asked, returning the hug.\n\n\"That sounds good, but it will have to be after you put your brothers and sisters to sleep. We have plans before that.\"\n\n\"Oh, right, the surprise. Mom is probably busy getting dinner ready, let's go see if we can help.\"\n\nDinner was quick. Sister and Brother Cole left for the dance with Christian and Rebekah leaving the clean-up for the babysitters. Mark wouldn't let me help. He recruited the girls instead for the dishes. I had Mark carry Micah downstairs so that he could watch Caleb and me set up for the party. We blew up balloons and hung them around the family room. Micah squealed at all the colors. I sent Caleb up to get bowls for the snacks while I got the music ready on the stereo. Before long, I heard the girls on the stairs giggling.\n\nA high pitched voice, attempting to sound like his sisters said, \"Can we come down yet?\"\n\n\"Well let's see, the girls can come in, but I am not sure about their goofy big brother.\" To this, the girls' giggles grew louder and they bounced down the stairs and into the room. They were followed by Mark with his head hung sheepishly. I laughed and ran to take his hand. \"Of course you can come in, the surprise is for you.\" He took in the room and his eyebrows rose. \"You said you felt like celebrating. Welcome to our dance.\"\n\nI walked over to the stereo and started the music. The girls jumped up and down and Ruth led Anna over to the snack table. Caleb was already there shoving chips in his mouth. I pulled Mark into the middle of the room to dance with me. He recognized the song as soon as it started. \"Were you in my room?\"\n\nI looked as innocent as I could, \"What do you think I needed Caleb for? But I must say, you do seem a bit obsessed with sports cars,\" I said, thinking of the posters I had seen all over the walls.\n\n\"Hey, those are Christian's, and I thought you said Caleb went in for the music?\"\n\n\"He did, but I helped your mom with laundry this week and I had to put some clothes in on Christian's bed.\" And then because I couldn't resist, I add, \"Were all the scrubs on the floor Christian's too?\"\n\nLooking guilty Mark sighed, \"No, those were mine, unless you would believe they belonged to him?\" He asked looking hopeful.\n\n\"Afraid not, but don't worry, your secret is safe with me.\" I reached up on my tiptoes and kissed his nose. When the song was over, I looked up to see that we had an audience. \"Time to get this party started.\" I proclaimed putting on some faster dance music, grabbing the girls by the hands, and moving to the dance floor. Mark carefully lifted Micah out of his chair and danced with him in his arms. We tried to get Caleb to come over with us, but he headed back to the food table.\n\nDuring the next hour, I managed to dance with every Cole man in the room. Micah was heavier than I had realized, so Mark helped me. Caleb was pretty good with the slow dances. I found out that Sister Cole teaches all of her boys to foxtrot and waltz. Thankfully, I had taken a social dance class last year, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to keep up. It was late when Mark announced, \"Time for the Coles to go to bed.\" Cutting in on Caleb, he took me for one more turn around the floor, then he gently scooped up Micah. \"See you outside in a while, Caleb.\"\n\n\"Can I put you to bed tonight?\" I asked, turning to Ruth and Anna.\n\n\"Yeah!\" they hollered and we raced up the stairs. Ruth was first and already brushing her teeth by the time I reached the hallway. Anna was really good at finding the things she needed in the bathroom. I watched her in appreciation.\n\n\"Tell us a story!\" the girls yelled, as I tucked them into their beds.\n\n\"It's been a long day guys. I'm not sure I have a story tonight.\"\n\n\"Come on, you can do it.\" Ruth was pleading.\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"Once in a land that was covered with fields. A single tree grew in the sun...\"\n\nThe girls were yawning as the story finished. \"Time to sleep now.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Megan. Love you.\"\n\n\"Love you too.\" As I exited the girls' room, I could hear Mark singing to Micah. I went back downstairs to start cleaning up.\n\nIt wasn't long before Mark joined me. He started the music up again and took the balloon out of my hand. \"May I have this dance?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said, feeling a little shy.\n\nHe led me around the room for several minutes, holding me tightly in his arms. \"You know what I'm thinking?\" he said, breathlessly.\n\n\"No. What?\"\n\n\"I'm thinking that it is a little too private down here. Let's clean up and go upstairs.\" He blushed as he spoke, but I didn't laugh; upstairs seemed much safer to me too.\n\n\"We could make some zucchini bread for breakfast tomorrow and read scriptures while it bakes.\"\n\n\"Excellent idea.\" He kissed me before he let me go with a sigh. \"I need to get Micah's chair upstairs. Can you handle this stuff?\"\n\n\"Yep, it's almost done.\" I turned off the music and grabbed the food bowls to take up to the kitchen.\n\n* * *\n\nThe next day at church was really fun. I found myself the center of attention as Mark led me in on his arm. Everyone had seen me before, but now it was obvious that things were different. Mostly, I think they could tell because Mark was beaming. Feeling loved and cherished, I clung to his arm.\n\n\"So what's going on here?\" an old Sunday School teacher of Mark's asked.\n\n\"Well, you haven't met Megan yet have you?\" Then, he looked at me from the corner of his eyes, \"she's my.... girlfriend.\" I gave him a small nod so that he would know that I approved and he smiled even bigger. I wasn't sure how to count all these smiles if the smile never left his face.\n\n\"You sure can pick 'em Mark,\" he drawled and patted Mark on the back as he walked away.\n\nConfusion spread across my face. \"Is there a story there?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, that's just his way of saying you're beautiful.\"\n\nI shook my head in amused denial. Mark stopped me by resting his warm hand on my cheek. \"He's only partly right, though. You are so beautiful and yet your spirit outshines your face.\" I melted.\n\nSuddenly, I started to laugh. \"What?\" Mark asked, surprised by my response.\n\n\"I was just thinking how happy Mr. Wallace will be now that his Marky has found someone.\"\n\n\"Hey, you're right. We should stop in and say hi on our way to California. I want to show you off some more.\" Mark kissed my forehead and walked me to the truck.\n\nBy the afternoon, I was starting to feel a little exhausted from all that had happened in just a few days' time. I curled up in my sleeping bag and took a nap. Mark was lurking around the hallway when I woke up. It was obvious he was looking for me. \"Hi,\" I said, running my fingers through my messy hair.\n\n\"Hi,\" he said, almost glumly.\n\nRushing to him, I asked, \"Is something wrong?\"\n\n\"I just need to talk to you. Can we go outside?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said. I took his hand and together we walked through the front door.\n\n\"Megan, can I ask you something?\" He was so serious. I wondered what was up and I longed to make him smile again. We sat on the front porch steps.\n\n\"Sure, ask me anything.\"\n\n\"First of all, let me say that my feelings haven't changed no matter how you answer. I said I would always be here.\" Oh, boy this must be something major. I was worrying now.\n\n\"Okay, what is it?\"\n\nHe hesitated and I could tell that it was difficult for him to let the words out. \"Do you really love me for me, or am I just the first guy who didn't care about the whole surgery thing?\" He struggled with the right words and I bit my lip. \"I mean, it's okay if that is all I am. That can be good enough for me. I just need to know.\" He paused and I shook my head in dismay.\n\n\"Oh, Mark. I am so sorry.\" He hung his head and I quickly went on, seeing that he misunderstood. \"I am so sorry that you ever thought that. You know the other day when you told me how you felt? It was so nice just to be wanted, but right after that first feeling of relief my feelings exploded. It happened so quickly because I guess, I had been fighting it for so long. I started falling in love with you when you stopped to buy me aloe vera gel for my sunburn. I kept falling in love with you the day that we picked up Rebekah in Salt Lake and I told you my secret. I fell when you asked my roommates about me over and over during those awful months. I fell when I saw you with Mr. Wallace. I fell every time I heard you on the phone with your family and every time the guys teased you for being such a sap.\" I paused to make sure I had his attention and I lifted his chin so that he could see my eyes. \"The love that I feel is not out of gratitude to you, but rather in gratitude for you. I feel like I have been given a wonderful gift, and that gift is you, Mark.\"\n\nAs if to contradict me, he said, \"But all that stuff is just me being me.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" I smiled. \"You are generous, compassionate and caring. You put others first; loving you is natural.\" A tear trickled down his face and I kissed it away. I hoped that he understood. His shoulders seemed to lower a couple of inches as if he was sighing in relief. \"Silly, one of these days, I just may smack some sense into you for being willing to take less than you deserve. You deserve nothing less than complete devotion and I have to admit that you have mine, if you want it.\" And then because he seemed to need it, I wrapped my arms around him and held him as tight as I could.\n\nWhen he spoke his voice was hoarse, \"Thank you, but I definitely think I am the one who has been given the gift. You're glowing, you know.\"\n\n\"So I've been thinking... exactly how long have we been dating?\"\n\nHe bit his lip looking a little embarrassed. \"Almost two months. You figured it out, huh?\" He hung his head shyly, then looked up at me and grinned, clearly proud of himself.\n\n\"Sneaky. Do you think you could let me in on it next time?\"\n\nHe reached out and grabbed me into another hug. \"Okay, here it goes. Let me take you out tomorrow, please?\"\n\n\"Sure, but don't you have to work?\"\n\n\"Nope, I only work Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday this week. Then I'm off for the vacation.\"\n\n\"Where do you want to go?\"\n\n\"Why don't you let me work on that. Let's call it a surprise,\" he said with a smirk.\n\nThe front porch light flicked on and off. Brother Cole poked his head out, \"Dinner in five.\"\n\n\"Okay, we'll be right there,\" Mark assured him. Then he turned to me. \"Is this really happening?\"\n\nI knew exactly what he meant. I had been wondering that for four days now. \"I think so,\" I said, smiling so that I could almost feel the glow on my face. Mark leaned his head on my shoulder for a second and sighed. I turned and kissed his cheek then we went into the house arm in arm.\n\n* * *\n\n\"Okay, we've been driving for a while. Are you going to tell me where we're going yet?\" I asked as I sat next to him in the truck.\n\n\"The future,\" he said grinning at my confused face.\n\n\"A little more information would be good.\"\n\n\"Relax. We are almost there.\" He pulled into a small real estate office in a tiny town. \"Wait here.\" After a few minutes, he returned with some papers.\n\n\"Okay, now you really have to tell me what is going on.\"\n\n\"I was looking on the internet a couple of weeks ago. I've heard you talk about your summer camp so much that this place seemed to have a lot of potential.\" He handed me a map. \"Now help me find it, navigator.\"\n\nI squealed a little and jumped up and down in my seat, but in a really dignified way. We drove to a small dirt road about ten miles out of the town. The high trees shaded it on either side. \"It's beautiful. Too bad it won't be here when I graduate.\"\n\n\"We can still enjoy it and get some ideas. It's good practice.\" He pulled the truck to a stop and came around to open my door. Excited, I almost ran across the small field in front of me. Mark looked at the papers and gave me the information, \"It says here that it is 60 acres. Most of it is wooded. I think this is the largest clearing, but I can't be sure just looking at the map here.\"\n\nHe handed me the map and together we tried to figure it out. The copy was bad and it was hard to read the topographical information. \"Guess we'll have to explore to find out.\" Then, I did give in and ran across the field because I just couldn't help myself.\n\nMark laughed at me and followed. We hiked all over the little property and he was right, there was potential everywhere. There was even a large pond that would be perfect for some water activities. We sat in the meadow eating the picnic lunch he had brought and I sketched out buildings on the map of the site. \"I think the mess hall should go here and then some little cabins nestled up among those trees. That one lookout we saw would make a great place for campfire gatherings, don't you think? The papers say that there is electricity at the road. It shouldn't be too much to bring it to the buildings. I wonder about sanitation and water.\"\n\nMark smiled at me and brushed the hair out of my face with his fingers. \"I think you are amazing and can do anything.\"\n\nI beamed at him for a moment, then said, \"Thank you so much for bringing me here. It is so much fun to dream. You are the best!\" I leaned in to kiss him and then I added. \"By the way, we still need to find the perfect place for my cabin. Tag you're it.\" I jumped up and ran for the woods.\n\nHe caught me before I reached the trees. \"You can build your cabin anywhere as long as it isn't too far from me.\" He wrapped me in his arms and I enjoyed another big bear hug.\n\nWe packed up to go home and I was sad to leave. \"Today was wonderful! I love you, thanks again for bringing me.\"\n\n\"I love hearing you say that. I love you. I love your beautiful dreams, too. It is so fun to watch you plan them.\"\n\n\"I think you are a little deluded. It's just a summer camp.\"\n\n\"I've been listening for a few months now and watching too. You're not planning just any summer camp.\" I looked at him puzzled. He continued, \"You are planning a camp where kids will be taught to enjoy the spirit of being in nature. It could be a place where even kids like Micah and Anna can feel that spirit. When you spent the day in that wheelchair and you were upset because people treated you funny, I could tell you were starting out on a mission. Then the whole Mr. Wallace thing just made everything clear. I almost cried when you met Micah for the first time and you gently touched him and spoke right to him. Nobody does that but the family. You have a special talent for loving all people, Megan. I can see it in your eyes.\"\n\nI considered what he was saying. It hadn't ever occurred to me in all my planning who the camp would be for, but he was right. Now that I considered it, I couldn't think of anything better. \"I think your plans and mine go wonderfully together.\" It was so amazing to me how well he knew my heart.\nChapter 19\n\nWe began packing the large van and Mark's truck on Thursday. The plan was to leave Saturday morning, spend that night with Sister Cole's parents, and then attend church with them on Sunday. As we loaded, I was sure there was no way we were going to fit everything. All of my stuff had to be loaded as well because I was going home right after the trip. The Coles had truly become family and I was really going to miss them.\n\nMark pulled everything out of the back of his truck when he got home from work. \"Hey, we just packed that,\" I complained. \"What, are you feeling left out and you want to do the work over?\" He had driven Christian's car to work that day so that we could start the packing and now he was undoing it.\n\n\"Nope, I'm just up to something. Go in the house and find something to do for the next hour.\"\n\nI frowned at him. He'd been gone all day and I missed him. He saw my frown and kissed it. He took my hand and walked me into the house. \"I'll hurry, just stay in here, okay?\"\n\nFriday was spent in last minute details. Trying to find Christian's sunglasses and Anna's hat was only part of the chaos. Mark worried about his mother's stress levels and hovered around her, helping out where he could. I focused on running Anna, Caleb and Ruth into the ground so that they would be tired for the long ride the next day. We had bike races, tree climbing contests, and my favorite \u2013 a gymnastics exhibition on the trampoline. Caleb was quite good with backward somersaults and I managed a forward flip even though I was out of practice.\n\nAn early night was a mandate handed down from Brother Cole after dinner. We all went to bed at nine o clock so that the 6 am departure time wouldn't be so bad. The tent had been packed away so Mark had been allowed back in his room for the last night, but Brother Cole slept in the family room right by Mark's door. I found the precautions a little insulting ... but mostly funny. Mark didn't seem to think anything of it.\n\n* * *\n\nIn the morning, Mark found me waiting in line outside the bathroom. \"How are you?\"\n\n\"I'm great,\" I said. Listening to the voices of the family bouncing around the house was so homey. Someone was missing their shoes and another person was looking for their CD. \"I get to ride with you, right?\" I said, gesturing with my head towards the noise.\n\nHe answered by drawing me into a hug and whispering in my ear, \"Do you think I would let them have you? You're all mine. They will have to fend for themselves. Besides, who's going to drive while I sleep?\" He leaned back and looked at me as he said this last part. I acted shocked and pulled away because finally it was my turn in the bathroom.\n\n* * *\n\nWe were all loaded up and backing out of the driveway on the start of the first Cole family vacation. It was 6:15 \u2013 not too bad for getting ten people dressed, fed and having family prayer too. I was glad that Mark and I were driving the truck together. It would give us lots of time to talk. I was nowhere near ready to let him go. The first leg of the trip was about five hours but we stopped over in Provo for an early lunch.\n\nMark and I stopped in to see Mr. Wallace briefly because Mark had something he really wanted to tell him. As he walked through the door, he called, \"Mr. Wallace, I brought someone to see you.\"\n\n\"What... Who is it? Marky, you're back!\"\n\n\"Actually, I just stopped by to bring you a visitor.\" He pulled me through the door and I smiled at the grumpy man sitting up in a chair by his bed. \"Don't get any ideas though, she all mine.\" Mark wrapped his arms around me like a shield and he leaned over my shoulder and kissed my cheek.\n\n\"Oh, she is, huh? Well it's about time you found someone and....\" he paused, looking me up and down appraisingly, \"this one I don't even hate. Congratulations.\"\n\nSuch words from Mr. Wallace were high praise and I bent to give him a hug. We stayed long enough to push Mr. Wallace around the courtyard and say hi to a few other residents; then it was back to the road.\n\n* * *\n\nIt had been such a long day and we were all grateful to be at the Kimball's house, finally. Mark's grandparents were funny people with lots of questions for me. Brother Kimball pulled me aside an hour after we arrived to ask me if I was in love with his grandson. The smile on his face told me that I could tease him a little bit, so I replied, \"Which one?\" He laughed and then placed a hand on my shoulder.\n\nWalking me to a quieter corner for confidentiality, he stared me down. \"Answer the question, Miss.\" I couldn't help but giggle. I felt more than a little put on the spot and I was strangely reminded of Mr. Wallace.\n\nHe continued to stare. \"Yes,\" I finally said. \"I am very much in love with your grandson.\"\n\nHe started to pat my shoulder with his hand. \"Good girl. You're smart, too.\" Then he winked at me. Shortly after that, I was rescued by Mark who had managed to hear most of the exchange and was laughing at my discomfort. He led me safely out to the kitchen.\n\n\"Oh, yeah! Just wait. You get to meet my dad when you take me home. Grandpa in there is nothing compared to him,\" I said, poking him lightly in the ribs.\n\nMark looked a little nervous, but he squeezed me in close with his arm around my shoulder. \"If his questions are that easy, I'll have no problem.\"\n\nMark's grandmother, Pearl, as Brother Kimball liked to call her, busied herself with trying to fatten me up. It was funny because I wasn't exactly skinny. Sister Cole just rolled her eyes up to the ceiling at me during dinner when I was offered a third helping. I smiled and declined the extra food.\n\nOf course, the grand kids were hugged and doted on and fattened up as well. Brother and Sister Kimball were so happy to have everyone there, and they were happy that they weren't the ones doing the traveling this time. We got to bed rather late considering our long day of driving. Micah wasn't too comfortable in the different surroundings and Mark spent twice as long trying to put him to bed. Brother Cole was even singing with Mark tonight as he tried to ease his boy's tensions.\n\n\"Is Micah okay?\" I asked as they emerged after nearly 45 minutes. I had been sitting by the door of the large guest room where Micah, Caleb, Christian, and Mark were staying.\n\n\"He's asleep. We're just going to have to expect this on the trip.\" He put an arm around me and led me out into the living room.\n\n* * *\n\nThe next morning was a jumble of people, all trying to get washed and dressed for Church. I had showered the night before so that I could avoid the Sunday rush. Being too tired to care, I had gone to sleep when my hair was still wet; consequently it was a rat's nest. I spent a good half hour torturing the tangles. Mark knocked on the door of the large three season porch where the girls had spent the night. I sat on my sleeping bag, hair fallen forward picking through it with a vengeance. I didn't look up, knowing that if I did, my hair would look enormous in its current state.\n\n\"Good morning,\" he called as he opened the door.\n\n\"Hi, how did you sleep? Is everyone good this morning?\" I asked feeling certain that he would know that I meant Micah.\n\n\"Yes, we had a peaceful night. It looks like you had a visit from the crazy hair fairy, though.\"\n\nI laughed, still not looking up. \"Yeah, she and I are old friends.\" Then, I winced as I hit a tangle that pulled my hair.\n\n\"Are you okay? Can I help?\" He asked walking forward.\n\n\"Thanks, but I think I had better tackle this myself. You should go be with your grandparents. We're leaving tomorrow and they have missed you.\"\n\n\"Well, good luck. It looks harrowing.\" He retreated and I sighed in relief. I wasn't quite sure what he would make of my big, crazy mane, but I guessed he was going to see it sooner or later if we were going camping. When the tangles were gone, I braided it and joined the family for breakfast.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Kimballs' ward was mostly older people. There were lots of retired folks, so the children were a special treat. I watched as Anna, Ruth and Caleb got their cheeks pinched several times just making their way to the pew where we were sitting. Used to winter visitors in Arizona, the room full of grandparents wasn't as novel to me as it seemed to the bewildered Ruth who looked around for anyone her age.\n\n\"Mom, do they have Primary here?\" She asked in doubt.\n\nSister Cole tried to reassure her, but looking around she was suddenly unsure herself. \"If not, you can come to Relief Society with me and Megan.\" Ruth perked up at the possibility.\n\nJust before the meeting started, Mark and Caleb were asked to help pass the Sacrament. They stood without delay and walked over to sit next to the men that were already in place. In Mark's absence, I slid my way down to Micah at the end of the bench and held his hand. He liked the hymns as the congregation sang and made contented noises.\n\nIt was hard not to get upset when the Relief Society lesson turned in to a 'this is what to do when you have kids' talk, directed at me. The younger girls had been taken off to a small Primary class with their Grandma Kimball. Ruth was a little disappointed, but I was sure that she was having more fun in Primary than I was in Relief Society right now. Sister Cole quickly came to my rescue trying to get everyone back on topic. I know that I just looked like a future mother to them, but it felt like an assault and I prayed trying to calm the pain.\n\nLater, I told Mark about the lesson and he became anxious. I tried to soothe him rubbing my arm on his shoulder and explaining that they just didn't understand. As soon as he realized that I was okay about it, he calmed right down. Stuff like this was going to happen a lot, I figured. Reassuring him had calmed me down too. Most of the time people meant well. I needed to learn not to let it get to me.\n\n* * *\n\nAfter another filling dinner and an early night, we were on the road again Monday morning heading toward California. We were now spread between three vehicles because we had added the RV. Brother Cole was driving it so Christian, Rebekah and I were all taking turns in the van to help Sister Cole with the driving. I was driving the van after a gas stop just into California when Micah started to fuss. We started to sing songs, any songs we knew. It was one of the more fun times on the trip that day. I wished Mark had been there to share it with us. Some of the silliest songs came from the younger girls and I wished that there were a class that would teach me all the new kid's songs.\n\nIt was a long day of driving, but we reached our first destination by dinner time. We were actually staying with the Martens for the night. There were old friends of Sister Cole's who owned an orchard. Space was limited so the boys were sleeping in the tent. The girls would all be bunking in the RV. Brother and Sister Cole would be in the house with Micah. Still, it was a beautiful farm and a fun setting to get into vacation mode.\n\nIt felt good to stretch my legs. Mark, Christian and I put the tent up. Then we joined the rest of the family inside the small farmhouse dining room for a late dinner. Sister Marten was so excited to have a crowd to feed. \"It's just like old times.\" She beamed as she placed serving bowl after serving bowl on the table.\n\nWith our stomachs full of Sister Marten's yummy dinner and after a long day of traveling, we were all ready for bed. Brother Cole didn't even have to try. \"To bed girls,\" he gently ordered, sweeping the group with his eyes that fell on each girl in turn, including me. We all followed without an argument. \"Boys, you too.\"\n\n\"Wait for me,\" Mark insisted, pulling me by the hand. He put one arm around me and one arm around Ruth and we walked to the RV parked at the back of the house. Anna followed behind with Rebekah and the three girls went inside while Mark and I paused, not wanting to say goodnight. I eyed the RV dubiously and hoped that leaving the windows open would help with how stuffy it had been in there this afternoon.\n\nAnna poked her head out of the door and holding onto the frame for support, she said. \"Are you going to kiss her, Mark?\" The question was followed by a chorus of giggles from behind her.\n\nI blushed as Mark grabbed me in his arms. Our show was spotlighted by the flood light on the Martens' back porch as he dipped me as if we were dancing and held me there. He paused to look up at his sisters now all watching from the door and sweetly said, \"Why, yes. Yes, I am.\" He gently kissed my lips to the delight of the giggling crowd and then he lifted me back up. Wobbling, I tried to plant both my feet again and he smirked. \"I must be a great kisser,\" he said quietly so that only I could hear, then he winked.\n\nSatisfied, the girls reentered the RV and made preparations for bed. I could hear Christian and Caleb arguing over who got to sleep next to the door in the tent about 30 feet away. Remembering similar arguments between the twins, I gestured with my head towards the noise and teased, \"Good luck.\" The glow of a flashlight was casting lively shadows on the walls of the tent and it sounded like the fight was growing intense. I turned to go get ready for bed, but Mark stopped me again.\n\n\"I do get a goodnight kiss, don't I?\"\n\n\"You can have lots if you want, but I thought you just did that?\"\n\n\"Exactly, I just did that. I need a kiss from you. Besides that one was just being silly, it doesn't count.\" He drew me to him and we lingered on a kiss as I enjoyed the strength in his arms while he held me. Resting my head on his chest again, I sighed feeling so joyous. We were shortly interrupted by another chorus of giggles. He tried to 'shhh' his sisters, but it failed so he reluctantly let me go. \"Sleep well. I love you.\"\n\n\"I love you, too.\" With a goofy smile plastered on my face, I floated into the RV. A couple of minutes later we heard another ruckus coming from the direction of the tent. Confident that they would have a solution to their fight soon, I climbed into the bed above the driver and passenger seats with Rebekah and fell asleep still smiling.\n\n* * *\n\nIn the morning, after a simple breakfast of muffins and eggs, Brother Marten took us around his orchard to show us the different types of trees he grew. It was still early in the season so most of the fruit was still green. We were in luck that he had a several trees of an early ripening variety. Brother Cole lifted Anna up so that she could feel a branch that was heavy with peaches. They were not as bright in color as some peaches I had seen, but they did smell wonderful. She smiled when she felt the curly leaves and the fuzzy texture of the peaches.\n\nThe peaches were especially fuzzy and after picking a basketful, my arms were itchy. Scratching only made it worse because the fuzz was on my hands. Brother Marten looked at me and smirked. \"Most of my varieties are newer and have been bred to reduce the fuzz. This one here is an antique variety, that's why I wear this,\" he said, pointing to the long sleeve flannel shirt he was wearing. I hadn't even considered bringing a long sleeve shirt in this summer heat. All of my clothes were packed down with my school things in the truck, but I didn't want to disturb Mark's neat packing job.\n\nThe itching was bad enough that I walked back to the house leaving the rest in the orchard. Mark came with me. He was torn between concern and amusement as I scratched. \"I think you may have a slight allergy,\" he said as we entered the house. He took me to the kitchen sink and scrubbed my arms with cold soapy water. It felt so nice that I only halfheartedly protested that I could do it myself. He had me clean under my nails really well and then examined my arms more closely. There was indeed a raised red rash, but it was so faint it was hard to see it under my scratch marks.\n\nMark and I sat out on the porch enjoying the morning and waiting for everyone to return from the orchard. \"Finally,\" he sighed.\n\n\"What?\" I asked laying my head against him.\n\n\"I just missed having you all to myself.\" This revelation made me happy and I lifted my head and kissed his cheek. He returned the kiss and brushed my hair gently with his fingers. \"You know, I have thought a lot about touching your hair over the past few months. It is softer than I imagined.\"\n\nI laughed, \"That's because I have to tame it with two kinds of conditioner just to get it to cooperate.\"\n\n\"I think it is so beautiful.\" He leaned his face against my hair and gently brushed his cheek back and forth.\n\n\"You're perfect.\" I said matter-of-factly.\n\n\"Hardly.\"\n\n\"No, I'm pretty sure. First, you think I'm wonderful despite all my... limitations and now you think my hair is beautiful. You are either perfect or very confused.\"\n\nHe hugged me in tighter. \"I don't have to be perfect to enjoy the beauty that you are. I've spent months trying to ignore it and I can tell you that's much more difficult.\"\n\n\"It's strange; I can't imagine my life without you. Everything just seems so right when you are near me.\" I was surprised that this idea wasn't frightening to me anymore.\n\n\"I feel the same way,\" he said, squeezing me again. He was definitely affectionate like his dad seemed to be. I could see Mark giving Brother-Cole-like bear hugs to his kids as he came home from work. I started to shy from the thought, worried that I might see a boy with curly brown hair and brown eyes, but I saw instead a Cole like family with every skin and hair color represented. The brief vision was overwhelming and tears came to my eyes.\n\nMark couldn't see my face, so the tears went unnoticed. I wasn't ready yet to share my thoughts with him on this. He had hinted at our future together and I honestly couldn't think of life without him, but I didn't want to freak him out. I got myself under control, then said, \"Let's go back to the orchard, I think my arms are better.\" He stood with me, then ran off to the tent before I could question. When he returned he was carrying a long sleeve flannel shirt similar to Brother Marten's.\n\n\"If we're going back out there, I want you to cover up.\" He handed me the shirt and I took it gratefully.\n\nWe found the group sitting on a small grassy area between a couple of trees at the end of the field. Juice was running down everyone's face and Caleb was trying to see how far he could spit the large pit. I reached for a peach, but Mark stopped me. \"Megan, I'm not so sure you should.\"\n\n\"I've eaten peaches lots of times. It will be fine,\" I protested, but he shook his head a little doubtfully.\n\nBrother Cole spoke up then. \"Here, Mark.\" He tossed Mark a small red object. It was a pocket knife. Mark smiled and grabbed a peach. He handed me the peeled peach. Juice was now running down his hands. I was a little embarrassed to be so babied, but thankful that I wouldn't have to touch the fuzz again.\n\nThe peach was so sweet and juicy. It tasted much better than the ones I'd had from the store. Self-consciously, I wiped the juice from my face with my sleeve and then remembered that I was wearing Mark's shirt. I looked up at him apologetically and he laughed, \"Well since it's already dirty...\" He reached around me in a hug and rubbed his sticky wet hands all over the back of the shirt. This won giggles from almost everyone except Brother Cole who cleared his throat and raised an eyebrow. Mark gave him an innocent look and released me, putting an arm around my shoulder.\n\n* * *\n\nWe all tromped in from the fields in the late morning. The heat was just starting to get uncomfortable. Mark and I were taking the small road back pushing Micah along the more even surface. By the time we caught up with the group (who had cut through the fields) they were in the middle of a water fight. Brother Cole was armed with the hose and happily squirting the dirt and stickiness off of anyone who got close enough. Sister Cole reappeared outside with a plastic bowl from the kitchen. While Brother Cole was focused on squirting Christian, she emptied its contents onto his back.\n\nBrother Cole whirled around and began to chase Sister Cole with the hose. The kids all laughed watching the exchange. Brother Marten whooped then cut the water to the hose. Finding himself unarmed, Brother Cole caught up to his wife and scooped her up into a hug, placing a kiss solidly on her lips as water from her hair dripped down their faces. It was such a perfect moment, I just watched silently.\n\nThe rest of the week was filled with such moments. Though vacationing was new to the Coles, playing together wasn't. Already I felt such a part of them that I didn't want to leave. The time was going much too fast, especially my time with Mark.\n\n* * *\n\nWe spent the rest of the day at the zoo then settled down for another early night before we drove to the redwoods. There was a bit of fighting among the girls that night. I think everyone was just tired. \"Hey guys? Why didn't the shrimp share his treasure?\"\n\n\"It was too small?\"\n\n\"Good guess, but no. It was because he was a little shellfish.\"\n\nThe groans were loud and Mark couldn't resist checking on us.\n\n\"Everything okay in there?\"\n\n\"No,\" Rebekah complained. \"Megan is torturing us with bad jokes.\"\n\n\"Oh, if that's all. Better you than me. Goodnight.\"\n\n\"I heard that.\" I teased over all the giggles.\n\nThe next night we spent in a beautiful campground at the foot of the mountains. The day had provided many wonderful opportunities to feel amazement at God's creations. I sat around the campfire with the Coles who seemed much more subdued. One by one they turned in until only Mark and I were left to douse the fire.\n\nI crawled into the tent trying not to disturb my roommates. \"Goodnight, Megan,\" Anna lazily said.\n\n* * *\n\nThe next morning I was woken up by a little knock at the girls' tent. \"Megan, wake up.\" Startled, I sat up and looked at my watch; it was 5:30. This was way too early for Mark; something must be wrong.\n\nI poked my head out, \"Mark, what's the matter?\"\n\nHe looked a little embarrassed, \"Nothing, I just couldn't wait any longer. Can you come out?\"\n\n\"Give me a minute.\" Ruth and Anna were still asleep. Grabbing my clothes, I got dressed quietly. I unzipped the tent, tiptoed through, and zipped it up again hoping not to wake them.\n\n\"Get your shoes,\" he directed and I sat to put my shoes on. \"Okay, now come with me. I want to show you something.\" We walked a little ways from the camp. The sun was starting to rise, lighting the sky with yellow and orange.\n\n\"What are we doing?\"\n\n\"Just a minute, we're almost there.\" We passed a clump of trees and came to a little clearing. It was a beautiful picture.\n\n\"It's amazing! What a great idea. We should wake everyone up so they can see the sunrise.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" he said and walked over to an object in the distance that I hadn't noticed.\n\nIt was a beautiful hope chest. There was a big carved heart on the front and a goldfish on the lid. Speechless, I admired it lovingly.\n\n\"I made this for you, because I love you and because you bring so much hope into my life that I wanted to give some back to you.\" He opened up the lid and down inside was a ring box. Pulling it out he said, \"Please, marry me and I will try to fill your life with hope the way you fill mine with beauty and joy.\"\n\nI jumped into his arms and whispered in his ear, \"You can never have too much hope. Yes! Yes! Yes! I love you!\" He squeezed me tight and spun me around. \"You are such a blessing to me. I can't believe how happy I feel right now.\"\n\nI touched the hope chest running my fingers over the carving. He laughed, \"I did them myself. You can see I'm not very good, but it's the thought, right?\"\n\nI put my finger on his lips, \"Shh,\" I said. \"It's wonderful. I will treasure it. Thank you.\"\n\n\"I wasn't sure I could get it here without you seeing it. Lucky for me you didn't get nosy.\"\n\n\"Is this what the repack was about?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I was lucky to get it done in time. I finished late Wednesday night.\"\n\n\"And this?\" I asked holding up my left hand that now held my ring.\n\n\"Got it on my lunch hour, last week. Is it okay?\"\n\n\"Aside for the fact that it is incredibly beautiful, it means I get to keep you; so, it's perfect.\"\n\nHe beamed and I braced myself for another bear hug.\n\n\"Shall we go tell the family?\" He scooped me up off my feet and carried me back through the trees.\n\n\"What about my hope chest?\"\n\n\"It will be okay for a few minutes.\"\n\nMy mind shifted into planning mode and I blurted out my questions. I could always ruin a romantic moment. \"But what about the wedding? When? Where?\"\n\n\"Well, I won't settle for anything less than forever so it will definitely be in the temple. Other than that, you can pick. I'll be there wherever it is.\"\n\nI giggled and he gave me a quick peck on the lips. The he bellowed, \"Wake up, guys!\" I looked at my watch it was only a quarter 'til 6. Given the time, I buried my face in his shoulder and prepared for grouchy faces to appear.\n\nChristian and Caleb were the first to emerge from the boys' tent. They stumbled out of the flap as if they had been spinning in circles for hours. I laughed at their groggy expressions and then was stunned as Christian woke up enough to take in the scene. \"You finally did it!\" he shouted. \"It's about time, Bro.\"\n\nI looked up at Mark, curious about how long he had been thinking about this. He reddened slightly but then his eyes flicked to the RV door that was opening. \"What? We missed it?\" Rebekah complained as she came down the little steps. Brother and Sister Cole were sitting next to the camper door and they were both smirking.\n\n\"I knew you couldn't stick to the plan,\" Sister Cole said.\n\n\"Plan?\"\n\n\"He was supposed to do it in front of the family before he left for the backpack trip.\" Brother Cole explained.\n\n\"I just couldn't wait!\" Mark beamed. All this time he had not put me down and I was starting to feel a little silly. My attempts to wiggle free only made him hold me tighter. \"Stay, please. I'm not ready to let go yet,\" he whispered in my ear. I gave up and my head back on his shoulder. I would just have to look silly a little longer. For Mark, I could deal with that.\n\nFinally, all the noise woke up the little girls and they came out to see what was going on. Mark smiled and said, \"At least I get to tell someone. Megan and I are getting married!\"\n\nRuth took one look at me in him arms and said, \"Right now?\"\n\n\"No, I wish, but we have to wait,\" he said, then put me down on the ground.\n\n\"Can I be at your wedding?\" Anna asked me.\n\n\"Sorry, but were going to be sealed in the temple. You can be in the pictures and at the reception, though. We can even get you a pretty new dress,\" I said.\n\n\"I've been in the temple. I got sealed to Mom and Dad,\" Anna answered. \"It's wonderful.\"\n\nI brushed my hand along her hair and said, \"I think it's wonderful, too.\"\n\nMark sent Christian and Caleb to get the hope chest. Brother Cole gave me a real, feet-off-the-ground bear hug, my first from him. \"Welcome to the family,\" he said, tearing up.\n\nSister Cole gave me a hug too, and then hugged Mark. She held him a long time. \"I don't know what I'm going to do without you. I'll miss you, kid,\" she said.\n\n\"You don't need me, Mom. You've had things running smoothly for years. You just let me help to keep me out of your hair.\" They laughed and she wiped her eyes.\n\n\"Well, since you woke everyone up so early, we may as well get started on breakfast. I'm glad this vacation is going to be so cheap, since we have wedding travel ahead.\" Sister Cole busied herself getting the food for breakfast.\n\nMark pulled me in one more embrace and kissed my left hand, touching the ring there. \"I'll be back.\" Then he went off to pack my hope chest safely back into the truck. I went to help make breakfast.\n\nAfter we'd packed everything up, we drove to Yosemite. I was tempted to call my parents and tell them the news, but doing it in person seemed so much more fun.\n\n* * *\n\nChristian and Mark left for their overnighter right after breakfast the next morning. I tried to get into the planned activities for the day, but I was very distracted. If I missed Mark so much now, what were the next six weeks going to be like?\n\nThe Coles, minus the two oldest boys, wandered around the park enjoying. In the afternoon, Brother and Sister Cole even got to take a walk by themselves while Rebekah and I kept everyone else busy.\n\nI spent that night tossing and turning. I woke up every couple of hours and checked my watch. I thought about the trail the guys were on and pictured them nestled down in their sleeping bags. Everyone else was sleeping; I tried to go back to sleep, too.\n\nWith the dawn I was up and wandering the camp. There was nothing to do really. We would be staying another night so packing up was unnecessary and Sis. Cole had insisted the camp be cleaned up before we went to bed.\n\nI took the quiet time to read my scriptures and ponder on the way Heavenly Father had blessed my life in such a short time. When I considered the answers I'd received to my prayers, I was humbled. There were so many people in my life he'd used to answer my prayers.\n\n* * *\n\nBy the afternoon, the brothers had returned and I was at Mark's side again. Around the campfire that night, we were rewarded with the tale of Christian and the bear. Apparently, he had excused himself for a call of nature at sunset last night and had seen a bear in the distance. Hurrying back to Mark, the two double checked the campsite to make sure they didn't have any food around.\n\n\"So glad we listened to you and strung our food up for the night in some trees away from our sleeping bags,\" Christian said to me shaking his head. \"We heard the bear trying to get to it in the middle of the night.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it was pretty scary,\" Mark agreed. \"But lucky for us, Christian smelled bad enough that the bear stayed away.\" This last comment won Mark a wadded shirt to the head. Christian was chuckling and shirtless.\n\nBrother Cole broke up the party before Mark could retaliate. \"Come on, son. I want some help repacking the van for tomorrow.\" Mark kissed me on the forehead then ran off to help his dad.\n\n* * *\n\nThe next morning we were heading home. \"You know last night when I helped my dad?\" Mark spoke up as we drove.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"He wanted to have 'the talk' with me.\" He grinned as he looked to see my reaction.\n\n\"Really? How did that go?\" I asked, my eyes wide.\n\n\"Just fine. He was more concerned with making sure I treated you like a treasure than about the physical stuff. I told him not to worry because he had set that example for me my whole life.\" Mark teared up a little as he spoke.\n\nI nodded agreement with this. \"Plus, I think you have a natural talent for making me feel special.\" I pulled his hand up to kiss it. \"Gee, I wonder what kind of talks I'll get when I go home.\"\n\n\"I guess we will find out. Your Dad is smaller than mine, right?\" Mark asked sounding nervous. I laughed and he rolled towards the window for a nap.\n\n* * *\n\n\"Hi, how long was I out?\" He sat up and his face was lined from where he had been resting it on the window.\n\n\"About three hours. We are almost to the Arizona border. Feel better?\"\n\n\"Yes, do you need me to drive?\"\n\n\"Nope, I have the hang of it now. Thanks for teaching me.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm really glad you know how. It saves me from having to teach you this winter.\" Funny, it hadn't occurred to me yet that I would be driving the truck a lot more once we were married.\n\n\"Hey, Megan. How quickly do you think you could plan a wedding?\"\n\nI smiled at him, my thoughts running along the same lines. \"It wouldn't take too long. When do you want to do it?\"\n\n\"Soon, I can't think of anything I want more than you for eternity. I am ready to make you mine right now.\"\n\n\"August?\" I asked, mentally crunching the numbers.\n\n\"YES!\" I smiled at his enthusiasm and he kissed my hand.\n\n\"Mom is going to kill me for the short notice, but we can do it. Where?\"\n\n\"Utah's part way for each family and yours has to get you to school anyway right?\"\n\n\"Provo?\"\n\n\"I will call the temple as soon as we get to your house.\"\n\n\"We should probably tell my family first.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you're probably right.\"\n\n\"It's funny, even though I am going home, I feel like my home is here with you.\"\n\n\"A home!\" Mark said, slapping his hand to his forehead. \"I guess I will look for an apartment on my way back to Idaho, too. So many things to do.\"\n\nI laughed, \"Nothing too expensive. We are going to need to start our savings. With any luck maybe we will have enough to adopt when we graduate.\" He smiled widely at this and squeezed my hand.\n\nWhat an amazing gift I was being given. My heart soared in prayer, thanking my Heavenly Father for strengthening my weakness, and sending me someone who could love me for who I am.\nAbout the Author\n\nMelody Burris once ventured deep down into the crust of the earth, only to find that she was claustrophobic.

In each congregation, they are organized into a Quorum, with a president (who has two Counselors for assistance), secretary, and instructors.\n\n2. Ward: A congregation. In the LDS church, congregations are assigned by geography, so where you go to church is a function of where you live. In areas with high concentrations of Mormons, like BYU, a ward can encompass just two apartment buildings out of a complex.\n\n3. LDS men are encouraged to serve a two-year mission for the Church beginning at age 18 \u2013 back then, it was 19. Missionaries are assigned to a locale, and given training in leadership and teaching skills (and language, if necessary.) LDS missionaries are assigned companions \u2013 someone they must be with and work with at all times.\n\n4. Harris Fine Arts Center\n\n5. Fireside: an evening church meeting, generally instructional.\n\n6. FHE = Family Home Evening. LDS families are instructed to set aside one night a week for family gatherings, gospel teaching, and worthwhile interaction. At BYU, since everyone is somewhat alone, students are assigned to small groups to continue the practice. In each group, there will be an assigned \"Dad\" and \"Mom.\"\n\n7. Each member of the LDS church is visited by Home Teachers (a pair of Elders) and the women also have Visiting Teachers \u2013 a pair of women assigned by the Relief Society (the women's organization of the LDS Church.) The visits in each case are to make sure that there are no unmet needs (physical as well as spiritual.) To simplify reporting, the visiting teachers are divided into districts, and they report to a district supervisor, who collates the reports and passes them along to the President.\n\n8. Positions in the LDS Church are assignments extended from the leaders of the congregation, and the members can either accept or reject the call to serve in that capacity.\n\n9. Twice each year (in April and October), congregational meetings are suspended and the entire membership of the LDS Church has a televised meeting. There are two, two-hour sessions on Saturday for the general membership, one two-hour session for the men, followed by two more two-hour sessions on Sunday. Because the schedule is packed, the two hour session for the women is held a week before the big weekend of General Conference.\n\n10. The Marriot Center on BYU campus is the large arena used for basketball and events that require a lot of seating.\n\n11. This is LDS shorthand for being \"in tune with the Spirit,\" meaning being able to feel a prompting from God.\n\n12. A Bishop is the person in charge of an LDS congregation. He works under a Stake President, and a group of Wards is a Stake.\n\n13. There are four magazines put out by the LDS Church for the members; The Friend, for children up to age 12; The New Era, for teens 12 to 18; and The Ensign, for adults. The Ensign has, among other things, the monthly messages to teach during Home Teaching and Visiting Teaching. The last is The Liahona which is published in languages other than English.\n\n14. LDS meetinghouses are for weekly church events. Temples are sacred places for certain ordinances, primarily sealings, which allows families to stay together after death.\n\n15. This meeting has talks assigned to members of the congregation, but centers around an ordinance called Sacrament, the LDS equivalent of Communion or the Last Supper.\n\n16. A Personal Priesthood Interview is an interview with one's priesthood leader going over all one's responsibilities and duties. In a family, the priesthood leader is the father.\n\n17. Choose The Right\n\n18. The Young Women's program has three divisions: Beehives are 12 and 13 year olds, MIA Maids are 14 and 15, and Laurels are 16 through High School graduation.\n\n19. Two popular phrases used by LDS leaders in the past.\n\n20. The name for the youngest class of children, 3 and 4 years old. Gospel lessons for this group are, of necessity, very basic and uncomplicated. That doesn't make those lessons any less true.\n\n21. Primary is the children's organization in the LDS Church. It covers Nursery for children from 18 months to 3 years, and other classes for children up to age twelve (including the Sunbeams, mentioned earlier).\n\n22. High-school level courses of scripture study, taught by a member of the local congregation before school or in areas with a larger LDS population they are held during the school day and are taught by a professional teacher.\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "BookCorpus2"}}}
