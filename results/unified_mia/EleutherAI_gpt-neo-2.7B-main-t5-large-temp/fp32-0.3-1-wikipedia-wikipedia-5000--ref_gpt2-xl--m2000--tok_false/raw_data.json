The GTDB is an initiative to establish a standardised microbial taxonomy based on genome phylogeny, primarily funded by an Australian Research Council Laureate Fellowship. The genomes used to construct the phylogeny are obtained from RefSeq and Genbank, and GTDB releases are indexed to RefSeq releases, starting with release 76. Importantly and increasingly, this dataset includes draft genomes of uncultured microorganisms obtained from metagenomes and single cells, ensuring improved genomic representation of the microbial world. All genomes are independently quality controlled using CheckM before inclusion in GTDB. The GTDB taxonomy is based on genome trees inferred with FastTree from an aligned concatenated set of 120 single copy marker proteins for Bacteria, and with IQ-TREE from a concatenated set of 53 (since RS207; 122 before) marker proteins for Archaea. Additional marker sets are also used to cross-validate tree topologies including concatenated ribosomal proteins and ribosomal RNA genes.

In 1950, the FDGB decided to move the workers into their own dedicated union, the \"Wismut Industrial Union\". It was based in Karl-Marx-Stadt, and led sports associations such as SC Karl-Marx-Stadt, and also the popular orchestra, Orchester der IG Wismut. Membership of the union gradually declined, along with employment by the company, and by 1989, it had 65,555 members. In March 1990, it became independent, and it dissolved in October, its members transferring to the Union of Mining and Energy. 1950: Richard Leppi 1951: Heinz Raeder 1952: Werner Lucas 1955: Heinz Sch\u00f6nfeld 1966: Herbert Strienitz 1985: Gotthard Stark 1990: Dieter May", "The Archbishop of Dhaka is the head of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dhaka, who is responsible for looking after its spiritual and administrative needs.

Its molecule can be described as that of propane with chlorine atoms substituted for the six hydrogen atoms on the extremal carbons. History and properties. There are 29 chlorinated derivatives of propane (four of them being hexachloropropanes, with the formula ). This was the last one of them to be synthesized\u2014by A. W. Davis and A. M. Whaley\u2014in 1950. 1,1,1,3,3,3-Hexachloropropane is a liquid that boils at 206 \u00b0C. Its boiling point is significantly higher than expected based on estimations from various molecular parameters. Production. The original synthesis by Davis and Whaley obtained the compound by reacting 1,1,3,3-tetrachloropropane and/or 1,1,1,3-tetrachloropropane with chlorine at 80-100 \u00b0C, through 1,1,1,3,3-pentachloropropane as an intermediate step. The compound can be produced quantitatively also by reacting carbon tetrachloride and 1,1-dichloroethene at 80-150 \u00b0C, with a copper-based catalyst, such as copper(I) chloride or copper(II) chloride, and possibly an amine as co-catalyst. The same process can generate higher chlorinated alkanes of the form . Applications.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Bears represent Brown University in the NCAA's Ivy League. Brown began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1900. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway. The NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983\u201384 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985\u201386 season, but Brown's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

It was marketed in the U.S. in the early 1930s. Design and development. As gliding become both a popular sport and an introduction to powered flight in the 1920s and '30s, most learned to fly solo, on single seat, low cost, open frame (uncovered fuselage) gliders. The Pegasus was the father of the type, the Z\u00f6gling the most imitated and the DFS SG 38 Schulgleiter the most numerous. The only instructions to the novices were shouted from the ground. The LPT-2 ((Leonard Primary Trainer, 2 seat) provided two seat training while retaining the low cost of the open frame design. It also reduced the complicated wire bracing required of the traditional flat girder fuselage by introducing a more rigid three longeron structure. The single seat LPT-1 offered a similar aircraft but more familiar training. The two spar, fabric-covered wings were trapezoidal in plan. The tail surfaces were almost rectangular on plan and profile apart from the angled lower edges of the vertical tail. Its fuselage structure was different from that of the German designs, which had a short box girder carrying the pilot and a rear flat frame, stiffened laterally with wire bracing which needed re-tensioning after each flight. Instead, the LPTs had welded steel tube fuselages with two lower longerons and a single upper one connected by several four-strut pyramids, eliminating wire bracing. The gliders were flown from the front seat, ahead of the leading edge, and in the early stages of training the instructor, provided with dual control, sat over the centre of gravity under the wing, close enough to advise or correct the pupil's control input. Alternatively the rear seat could hold a passenger. The glider was advertised in 1930 as the first production two seat training glider.

The term \"2.5D\" originated when 3D-ICs with TSVs were quite new and still very difficult. Chip designers realized that many of the advantages of 3D integration could be approximated by placing bare dies side by side on an interposer instead of stacking them vertically. If the pitch is very fine and the interconnect very short, the assembly can be packaged as a single component with better size, weight, and power characteristics than a comparable 2D circuit board assembly. This half-way 3D integration was facetiously named \"2.5D\" and the name stuck. Since then, 2.5D has proven to be far more than just \"half-way to 3D.\" Some benefits: Some sophisticated 2.5D assemblies even incorporate TSVs and 3D components. Several foundries now support 2.5D packaging.

Beyond his placement at some point during the rule of the Tiberian-Julian dynasty (8 BC \u2013 AD 341), the timespan of his reign is unknown and disputed. Identity and chronology. The sole evidence of Chedosbius' existence and reign is a stele erected in Kherson. The Chedosbius stele was discovered in the form of two fragments in 1913, one fragment containing an inscription with his name and titles and another containing an image of the king wielding a sword. Whereas the letters used in the inscription are characteristic of the third and fourth centuries, the image of a king with a sword was more widespread in the first and second centuries, a period which was also characterized by this type of stele. Based on the image and the text, Michael Choref concluded in 2020 that Chedosbius was likely king in the first half of the third century as a co-ruler of one of the more well-attested Tiberian-Julian kings, most likely Rhescuporis IV ().

In natural language terms, the principle means that the following English sentences are logically equivalent. Import-export holds in classical logic, where the conditional operator formula_2 is taken as material implication. However, there are other logics where it does not hold and its status as a true principle of logic is a matter of debate. Controversy over the principle arises from the fact that any conditional operator that satisfies it will collapse to material implication when combined with certain other principles. This conclusion would be problematic given the paradoxes of material implication, which are commonly taken to show that natural language conditionals are not material implication. This problematic conclusion can be avoided within the framework of dynamic semantics, whose expressive power allows one to define a non-material conditional operator which nonetheless satisfies import-export along with the other principles. However, other approaches reject import-export as a general principle, motivated by cases such as the following, uttered in a context where it is most likely that the match will be lit by throwing it into a campfire, but where it is possible that it could be lit by striking it. In this context, the first sentence is intuitively true but the second is intuitively false.", "\"The First Step\" (AKA: \"The Morals of Diet\") is an article by Leo Tolstoy primarily advocating for vegetarianism, but at the same time also briefly mentioning themes relating to anarchism and pacifism. It was Tolstoy's preface to a book by Howard Williams (\"The Ethics of Diet\"), which Tolstoy translated into Russian. Content. According to South African novelist Imraan Coovadia, writing in 2020, the article begins with a vivid description of the slaughter of a pig by a butcher armed with a butcher's knife; Coovadia notes that this is clearly in line with Tolstoy's style of \"plainness and force.\" While it is a book about the rights of animals, it also takes a decidedly religious tone, invoking that one must practice self-abnegation, fasting, and renouncing worldliness. Ronald D. Leblanc, lecturer at University of New Hampshire, says that the essay is divided into two unequal halves, the first about religious and ascetic reasons for vegetarianism, while the latter half is about the humanitarian and ethical reasons for vegetarianism. In addition, Tolstoy suggests that vegetarianism gives one sufficient strength to resist sexual impulses, which has drawn criticism from contemporary psychologists who describe the piece as \"pseudo-erotic.\" Tolstoy ends the piece taking a more psychological approach, suggesting that the killing and eating of animals deafens the sense of human beings to feel sympathy, pity, and compassion for others around them. Legacy. This work was considered instrumental in convincing Gandhi to maintain his vegetarian diet. According to Charlotte Alston, lecturer at Northumbria University, Tolstoy had planned to established a vegetarian journal in 1893, with the same title, \"The First Step.\" In 1900, it was translated to English by the famous Tolstoy translators Louise Maude and Aylmer Maude, and in 1905 it was translated again by Leo Wiener.", "Imanol Garc\u00eda de Alb\u00e9niz Crecente (born 8 June 2000), sometimes known simply as Imanol, is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a left back for Athletic Bilbao.

The present ranch, which was built around 1910, was the third European settlement constructed on the property. The ranch has mainly raised cattle and sheep. Settlers constructed two homesteads on the property in the 19th century, neither of which lasted long; the two homesteads only survive as archaeological remains.

The ranch is also the site of fifty-four archaeological sites which remain from Native American settlement in the area. A number of Paleoindian artifacts and a multitude of Archaic period projectile points indicate that settlement in the Wind Springs Creek Valley dates back several thousand years. Archaeologists separate the known sites in the area into sites in uplands and on butte tops, valley sites, and rock cairns.

It is an amalgamation of the different technologies and architectures for supercomputers and mainframes, namely high computing power and high throughput. History. In 2007, Hoplon and IBM jointly started the gameframe project in which they used an IBM System z mainframe computer with attached Cell/B.E. blades (the eight-core parallel-processing chips that power Sony's PlayStation 3) to host their online game \"Taikodom\". The project was carried further by a co-operation between IBM and the University of California, San Diego in 2009. Although the Cell blades account for the required computing power, it's the high data throughput of the mainframe which is of particular interest. System z provides a high level of security and massive workload handling, assuring the execution of its administrative tasks and guaranteeing an enduring connectivity to a huge number of clients. Cell/B.E. takes over the most resource demanding calculations thus enabling the System z to fulfill its job. The combination is both an effective and financially attractive game server system, as the most computation-intensive tasks are offloaded from the expensive CPU cycles of System z and are carried out on the much more economical Cell blades. Without offloading, the server system required would end up costing too much and would not be financially feasible. The gameframe can handle the required transactions (e.g. keeping track of each user's spaceships, weapons, and virtual money even between the players) and the simulation (trajectory of objects and checking for collisions) in a unified and consistent fashion. Thus, it can host a few thousand users at a time and higher efficiency is experienced when more users are added. Games with numerous players like \"World of Warcraft\" have tackled this problem by splitting the work among multiple clusters, creating duplicate worlds that don't communicate. The Cell-augmented mainframe runs Hoplon's virtual-world middleware, called \"bitVerse\", which", "Thomas Hymers (29 April 1935 \u2013 May 1987) was an English footballer who played as a defender (association football) in the Football League for Doncaster Rovers.

It is used to describe people or domestic animals who went missing in nature for unexplained reasons. People \"covered by forest\" were described as not being able to recognize the terrain around them, even if they were on familiar grounds. In other cases they might have walked endlessly through unfamiliar terrain, or were rendered completely paralyzed, unable to move or speak. Unnatural silence devoid of the sounds of nature was also common. People or animals under the influence of the phenomenon were described as becoming either completely invisible to other people, or looking like part of the nature around them, like a rock. In one story a man had been looking for a missing cow for days. When he finally gave up and returned to his work, the first tree stump he struck with his axe transformed back into his cow. The cause behind mets\u00e4npeitto was usually credited to maahinens, who were small humanoid creatures living underground (usually translated as \"gnomes\"). Some people managed to free themselves from mets\u00e4npeitto by their own means, for example by turning their jacket inside out, by switching their shoes to the wrong feet, or by watching world upside down through their own legs. This was because of the idea that everything was topsy-turvy in the lands of the maahinens. Some were released seemingly without reason, others only after being sought after by a shaman.

Also called silanolates, they are derived by deprotonation of silanols. They also arise by the degradation of siloxanes by base: R3SiOSiR3 + 2 NaOH \u2192 2 R3SiONa + H2O Cleavage of cyclic siloxanes affords siloxides: (Me2SiO)3 + MeLi \u2192 Me3SiOSiMe2OSiMe2OLi These anions function as ligands for metal ions, forming complexes similar to metal alkoxides. Sodium trimethylsiloxide is useful for generating metal complexes by salt metathesis reactions. A very bulky siloxide is tert-butyl3SiO\u2212, sometimes called silox. Siloxides are weaker net donors than alkoxides because p\u03c0-d donation has to compete with backbonding from the oxygen atom into the low-lying Si-C \u03c3* orbitals.", "Sugar and Spice is the 1966 debut album by The Cryan' Shames, originally released in mono (CL 2589) and in stereo (CS 9389).

It is closely related to the square knot, which can also be described as a connected sum of two trefoils. Because the trefoil knot is the simplest nontrivial knot, the granny knot and the square knot are the simplest of all composite knots. The granny knot is the mathematical version of the common granny knot. Construction. The granny knot can be constructed from two identical trefoil knots, which must either be both left-handed or both right-handed. Each of the two knots is cut, and then the loose ends are joined together pairwise. The resulting connected sum is the granny knot. It is important that the original trefoil knots be identical to each another. If mirror-image trefoil knots are used instead, the result is a square knot. Properties. The crossing number of a granny knot is six, which is the smallest possible crossing number for a composite knot.

The first instance is functions of a quaternion variable, where the argument is a quaternion (in this case, the sub-field of hypercomplex analysis is called quaternionic analysis). A second instance involves functions of a motor variable where arguments are split-complex numbers. In mathematical physics, there are hypercomplex systems called Clifford algebras. The study of functions with arguments from a Clifford algebra is called Clifford analysis. A matrix may be considered a hypercomplex number. For example, the study of functions of 2 \u00d7 2 real matrices shows that the topology of the space of hypercomplex numbers determines the function theory.

The Warrior Vase, dated to the 12th century BCE, is probably the best-known piece of Late Helladic pottery. It is a krater, a mixing bowl used for the dilution of wine with water, a custom which the ancient Greeks believed to be a sign of civilized behavior. The broad frieze of armed soldiers on the vase, which is incomplete, suggested the name that Schliemann gave it. The warriors are clad in short chitons, breastplates, helmets and greaves; they are armed with spears and carry shields. The bull's head handles for long encouraged scholars to date the piece later, in the early seventh century BCE. Many scholars observe that the style of the figures and the bull head handles of this thirteenth century BCE vase are very similar to eighth century BCE pottery. Similar spearmen are also depicted in eighth century BCE pottery, which introduces a curious 500-year gap in styles. This vase also leads to clues about post-palatial Mycenaean warriors. The knapsacks the warriors carry suggest that they may have to travel long distances to battle. Figures on one side of the vase wear helmets with horns. The other side depicts warriors in \"hedgehog\" style helmets. The latter is equipped with spears that are shorter than general spears depicted of the time. The warriors on both sides have shields, tunics, and leg", "The Last Concert is a live album by Rosemary Clooney, released through Concord Jazz in November 2002.

Function. CerS3 synthesizes C24-ceramides and ceramides with longer acyl chains, and is found mainly in skin and testis. Specifically, CerS3 synthesizes ceramides containing \u03b1-hydroxy (2-hydroxy) fatty acids, which are abundant in skin tissue, where they help maintain the water permeability barrier qualities of the skin. It is found in large quantities in keratinocytes, and this increases during keratinocyte differentiation. In the testes, CerS3 is involved in sperm formation and androgen production. Cers3 gene expression is located within germ cells, where it is massively upregulated during juvenile testicular maturation. This upregulation is correlated with increase in levels of glycosphingolipids containing very long chain (C26-C32) polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA), which are required for spermatogenesis. Tissue and cellular distribution. CerS3 (T3l) mRNA is strongly expressed in skin, and was also found in brain, lung and kidney. CerS3 is mainly found in the skin and testes.

In this process barium oxide reacts at 500\u2013600 \u00b0C with air to form barium peroxide which decomposes at above 800 \u00b0C by releasing oxygen. 2 BaO \u21cc 2 BaO2 + O2 The reaction was discovered by Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis-Jacques Thenard in 1811 and Jean-Baptiste Boussingault tried to use this reaction to establish a process to produce oxygen in 1852. The process worked only for a few cycles and then became inefficient. Two students of Boussingault, Quentin and Arthur Leon Brin, discovered that traces of carbon dioxide formed barium carbonate. Removing the carbon dioxide with sodium hydroxide solved this problem. In 1884 they opened a factory producing oxygen by their improved process. In the commercial process, oxygen capture and release was controlled by pressure rather than temperature, with oxygen being captured at high pressure and released at low pressure. This allowed a faster change between the capture and release phases, which would last one to two hours. The company was first named Brins Oxygen Company after the two brothers. In 1906 it was renamed as the British Oxygen Company. One major application of the oxygen was the use for limelight. Before the end of the 19th century electrolysis of water and fractional distillation of liquefied air became economically cheaper methods to produce oxygen and the process slowly faded out.", "Stewart v. United States, 366 U.S. 1 (1961), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that asking a criminal defendant whether he had testified in previous trials violated his Fifth Amendment rights. Willie Lee Stewart had already been tried twice for murder and had not testified in either trial. During his third trial his defense was insanity and he chose to testify in his own defense. During his cross-examination, the prosecutor asked, \"This is the first time you have gone on the stand, isn't it, Willie?\", alluding to the fact that Stewart had not testified in his first two trials. Stewart's attorney objected and ultimately appealed Stewart's criminal conviction to the Supreme Court. The Fifth Amendment provides a criminal defendant with a right to refuse to testify. Relying on that provision, the Court held that the prosecutor's question was unduly prejudicial and unconstitutional.

Many disk abnormalities seen on MRI that are loosely referred to as \"herniation\" are actually just incidental findings. These may be unrelated to any symptoms and are just bulges of the \"anulus fibrosus\". Jensen and colleagues, in an MRI study of the lumbar spine in 98 \"asymptomatic\" adults, found that in more than half, there was a symmetrical extension of a disc (or discs) beyond the margins of the interspace (bulging). In 27 percent, there was a focal or asymmetrical extension of the disc beyond the margin of the interspace (protrusion), and in only 1 percent was there more extreme extension of the disc (extrusion or sequestration). These findings emphasize the importance of using precise terms in describing the imaging abnormalities and evaluating them strictly in the context of the patient's symptoms.

Commonly known as the wrinkled flat-backed millipede, this species belongs to the order Polydesmida and the family Xystodesmidae. It inhabits forests in the southeastern United States, particularly those with hemlock, maple, tulip poplar, rhododendron, cedar, and spruce-fir trees. A 2022 study conducted a molecular phylogenetic analysis and confirmed that \"Cherokia\" includes only one species, \"C. georgiana\". This study found no evidence supporting the previously proposed subspecies based on morphological data. Instead, it revealed that \"C. georgiana\" exhibits significant morphological variation, specifically in characters such as the shape of the paranota and body size. These variables correlate with geographical distribution and elevation but not with phylogeny. The coloration of \"C. georgiana\" is highly diverse and does not align with either geography or phylogeny. \"Cherokia\" is closely related to the genus \"Pleuroloma\" and belongs to the tribe Rhysodesmini. It stands apart from other genera of Xystodesmidae due to distinct characteristics, including a wrinkly texture on its dorsal surface, horizontally wide paranota with minimal downward curvature, a straight telopodite on its gonopod (as opposed to the curved or twisted form found in the Apheloriini), a long icepick-like prefemoral process on the telopodite, and the absence of a receptacle in females' cyphopods.

The pressure is typically generated pneumatically by compressed air or other gases (nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc) or by electrical and magnetical fields or gravitation. Physical fundamentals. It is known from thermodynamics that conjugated quantities scale in a different manner. Two classes can be distinguished: intensive quantities as temperature \"T\", pressure \"P\" and amount of substance \"N\" or extensive quantities as entropy \"S\", volume \"V\" and chemical potential \"\u03bc\". Extensive quantities scale with system size, whereas the intensive quantities do not. The quantity pressure, for example, is defined as the (differential) quotient of two extensive variables: \"p\"=d\"E\"/d\"V\" (energy \"E\" and volume \"V\") and therefore scale independent as the same scaling factors appearing in the nominator as well as the denominator cancel. In microsystems the problem rises that the extremely small volumes are difficult to be controlled. The reason is the predominance of surface effects as surface charges, van-der-Waals forces and entropic effects (e.g. dewetting due to rough surfaces: the restriction in degrees of freedom of molecules penetrating such a surface is entropically more expensive than staying in bulk). Furthermore, the microsystem has to be controlled from a macroscopic human scale.", "Girolamo Arnaldi (31 January 1929 \u2013 30 January 2016) was an Italian historian.

The hypothesized process would have transformed four diploid nuclei into eight haploid ones. The current scientific consensus is that brachymeiosis does not occur in any fungi. According to the current understanding, ascomycetes reproduce by forming male and female organs (antheridia/spermatia and ascogonia), transferring haploid nuclei from the antheridium to the ascogonium, and growing a dikaryotic ascus containing both nuclei. Karyogamy then occurs in the ascus to form a diploid nucleus, followed by meiosis and mitosis to form eight haploid nuclei in the ascospores. In 1895, the botanist R.A. Harper reported the observation of a second karyogamy event in the ascogonium prior to ascogeny. This would imply the creation of a tetraploid nucleus in the ascus, rather than a diploid one; in order to produce the observed haploid ascospores, a second meiotic reduction in chromosome count would then be necessary. The second reduction was hypothesized to occur during the second or third mitotic division in the ascus, even though chromosome reduction does not typically occur during mitosis. This supposed form of meiosis was termed \u201cbrachymeiosis\u201d in 1908 by H. C. I. Fraser. The existence of brachymeiosis was controversial throughout the first half of the twentieth century, with many conflicting results published. Then, research with improved staining techniques established clearly that only one reductive division occurs in the asci of all examined species, including", "Nymphoides crenata, commonly known as wavy marshwort, is an aquatic perennial herb of the family Menyanthaceae endemic to Australia, found in all mainland states and the Northern Territory Description.

The Immunoscore has been internationally validated in colorectal cancer and provides better prognostic information than the current staging system, TNM. In other malignancies the Immunoscore has not yet been validated. It is based on Jerome Galon's finding from 2006 which revealed a positive association of cytotoxic and memory T cells with survival of colorectal cancer patients. Introduction. The most common system for classifying the extent of spread of cancer is the TNM classification, which has been used for over 80 years. However, its prognostic accuracy is limited and clinical outcome can significantly vary among patients within the same tumor stage. This method fails to incorporate the effects of the host immune response and focus only on the tumor cells. From the beginning of 21st century, growing evidences supports the important role of the immune system in cancer surveillance and clearance. The ability to avoid immune destruction has been introduced as a hallmark of cancer. Immunoscore incorporates the effects of the host immune response into cancer classification and improves prognostic accuracy. It measures the density of two T lymphocyte populations (CD3/CD8, CD3/CD45RO or CD8/CD45RO) in the center and at the periphery of the tumor. The Immunoscore provides a score ranging from 0 (I0) when low densities of both cell types are found in both regions, to Immunoscore 4 (I4) when high densities are found in both regions. The Immunoscore does not measure how the immune cells in the periphery of the tumor are organized, or the amount of B-cells, tertiary lymphoid structures and germinal centers.

It is typically far below the contact's nominal maximum current rating. A thin film of oxidation, or an otherwise passivated layer, tends to form in most environments, particularly those with high humidity, and, along with surface roughness, contributes to the contact resistance at an interface. Providing a sufficient amount of wetting current is a crucial step in designing systems that use delicate switches with small contact pressure as sensor inputs. Failing to do this might result in switches remaining electrically \"open\" when pressed, due to contact oxidation. Capacitor discharge solution. In some low voltage applications, where switching current is below the manufacturer's wetting current specification, a capacitor discharge method may be employed by placing a small capacitor across the switch contacts to boost the current through contact surface upon contact closure. Sealing current. A related term sealing current (aka wetting current or fritting current) is widely used in the telecommunication industry describing a small constant DC current (typically 1-20 mA) in copper wire loops in order to avoid contact oxidation of contacts and splices. It is defined in ITU-T G.992.3 for \"all digital mode ADSL\" as a current flowing from the ATU-C (ADSL Linecard) via the phone lines to the ATU-R (CPE). Carbon brushes develop high resistance glaze when they're used without current flow for an extended period.

It differs from the main body of Optimal Foraging Theory in stating that animals can select food in order to make optimal use of their digestive tract (maximize digestion rate) rather than the maximization of the food ingestion rate, which is the base of Optimal foraging theory. The basic tenet of the DRM is that the intake of energy by an animal passes through two consecutive processes, food ingestion or foraging, and food digestion. Optimal foraging theory describes the diet selection if the food ingestion rate is the limiting factor. The DRM describes diet selection and foraging behavior if digestion is the rate limiting process. Food can consist of varying fractions of largely indigestible parts such as fibre in plant material, shells of molluscs or insect chitin, which can be thought of as 'rate limiting' for the digestion process", "Sherbrooke is a ghost town in Steele County in the U.S. state of North Dakota.

More than 26 medieval manuscripts exist containing it, all of which give Eustathius of Antioch as the author. The work contains rather more material than a typical commentary on creation, including historical material down to the time of Alexander the Great, all excerpted from earlier Christian writers. Consequently, it has been given the Latin title \"Liber chronicorum\" ('book of chronicles'). The \"Commentary\" includes extracts from the lost writings of Alexander Polyhistor, and the author appears to have had direct access to copies of Polyhistor. It is also a useful early witness to the \"Physiologus\". That it could not have been written by Eustathius of Antioch, who was deposed in 330, is clear from the material it draws from the \"Homilies on the Hexameron\" of Basil the Great, delivered around 370. In addition, Eusebius of Caesarea is labelled \"holy\" in the work, despite being an enemy of Eustathius. Although these factors mean that the name passed down in the manuscripts as author cannot be right, no other obvious candidate for authorship is available.

For example, the \"cis\" or \"trans\" alkenes, \"R\" or \"S\" enantiomers, and \"R,R\" or \"R,S\" diastereomers. In a mixture of enantiomers, these methods can help quantify the optical purity by integrating the area under the NMR peak corresponding to each stereoisomer. Accuracy of integration can be improved by inserting a chiral derivatizing agent with a nucleus other than hydrogen or carbon, then reading the heteronuclear NMR spectrum: for example fluorine-19 NMR or phosphorus-31 NMR. Mosher's acid contains a -CF3 group, so if the adduct has no other fluorine atoms, the 19F NMR of a racemic mixture shows just two peaks, one for each stereoisomer. As with NMR spectroscopy in general, good resolution requires a high signal-to-noise ratio, clear separation between peaks for each stereoisomer, and narrow line width for each peak. Chiral lanthanide shift reagents cause a clear separation of chemical shift, but they must be used in low concentrations to avoid line broadening.", "Manuel \"Manolo\" Cintr\u00f3n Vega (born January 4, 1963 in Ponce, Puerto Rico) is a former Puerto Rican professional basketball player, who for 11 seasons in the 1980s and early 1990s played with several teams in the National Basketball League in Puerto Rico., including the Atl\u00e9ticos de San Germ\u00e1n, the Leones de Ponce and the Gigantes de Carolina.

Many applications call for a crystal oscillator frequency conveniently related to some other desired frequency, so hundreds of standard crystal frequencies are made in large quantities and stocked by electronics distributors. Using frequency dividers, frequency multipliers and phase locked loop circuits, it is practical to derive a wide range of frequencies from one reference frequency.

Impiety is often closely associated with sacrilege, though it is not necessarily a physical action. Impiety cannot be associated with a cult, as it implies a larger belief system was disrespected. One of the Pagan objections to Christianity was that, unlike other mystery religions, early Christians refused to cast a pinch of incense before the images of the gods, an impious act in their eyes. Impiety in ancient civilizations was a civic concern, rather than solely religious (as religions were tied into the state). It was believed that impious actions such as disrespect towards sacred objects or priests could bring down the wrath of the gods. Ancient Greece. The issue of impiety in antiquity is very controversial because of the anecdotal nature of extant sources. A number of Athenian men, including Alcibiades, were sentenced to death for impiety in 415 BC, most of whom fled Athens before execution (Andocides was later charged in 400 or 399 BC in reference to these events).

In the duodenum, dietary fat (primarily triglycerides) is digested by enzymes such as pancreatic lipase into smaller molecules of 1,2-Diacylglycerols and free fatty acids, which can be absorbed through the wall of the jejenum of the small intestine and enter circulation for metabolism and storage. Since fat is a valuable nutrient, human feces normally contains very little undigested fat. However, a number of diseases of the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract are characterized by fat malabsorption. Examples of such diseases are: Microscopy. In the simplest form of the fecal fat test, a random fecal specimen is submitted to the hospital laboratory and examined under a microscope after staining with a Sudan III or Sudan IV dye (\"Sudan staining\"). Visible amounts of fat indicate some degree of fat malabsorption. Quantitative. Quantitative fecal fat tests measure and report an amount of fat. This is usually done over a period of three days, the patient collecting all of their feces into a container. The container is thoroughly mixed to homogenize the feces, without using specific mixer equipment. A small sample from the feces is collected. The fat content is extracted with solvents and measured by saponification (turning the fat into soap). Normally, up to 7 grams of fat can be malabsorbed in people consuming 100 grams of fat per day. In patients with diarrhea, up to 12 grams of fat may be malabsorbed since the presence of diarrhea interferes with fat absorption, even when the diarrhea is not due to fat malabsorption.", "Whale Beach is a northern beachside suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia.

Property income is nominal revenues minus expenses for variable inputs (labor, purchased materials and services). Property income represents the return for the supply of both physical capital and financial capital. Capitalist economic systems are usually defined as those systems where the means of production are privately owned through equity, stock, bonds or privately held by a group of owners who bear the risk of investment and production to generate returns. In Marxian economics and related schools, property income is a portion of the surplus value produced by an economy, where \"surplus value\" refers to value beyond what is needed for subsistence. As such, income derived through property ownership constitutes a type of \"unearned income\" on the basis of economic exploitation for the capitalist class that receives and lives off of property income, because its recipients receive property income by virtue of owning property regardless of their contribution to the social product.

Function. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the iodothyronine deiodinase family. It activates thyroid hormone by converting the prohormone thyroxine (T4) by outer ring deiodination (ORD) to bioactive 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3). It is highly expressed in the thyroid, and may contribute significantly to the relative increase in thyroidal T3 production in patients with Graves' disease and thyroid adenomas. This protein contains selenocysteine (Sec) residues encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTR of Sec-containing genes have a common stem-loop structure, the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS), which is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon rather than as a stop signal. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. Interactions.

The hypothesis of the operation appears to be that reduction (resection) of marginally viable ventricular mass may result in superior geometric remodeling thus conferring better performance when faced with ventricular failure. In spite of promising initial results, the method was soon found to be of little if any benefit, and it is no longer considered a recommended treatment for the disease. The Batista procedure was invented by Brazilian physician and cardiac surgeon Randas Batista in 1994 for use in patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Many of his patients were victims of Chagas disease. Chagas disease represents a parasitic nonischemic cardiomyopathy targeting parasympathetic inflow to the heart. Chagas cardiomyopathy thus represents a unique method of study of diastolic heart failure. It may be addressed by removal of a portion of viable tissue from the left ventricle to reduce its size (partial left ventriculectomy), with or without repair or replacement of the mitral valve. Although several studies showed benefits from this surgery, studies at the Cleveland Clinic concluded that this procedure was associated with a high early and late failure rate.

A common application of this class of reactions involves the introduction of chirality. Formally, such conversions required the loss of an improper axis of rotation (mirror plane, center of inversion, rotation-reflection axis). In other words, desymmetrisations convert prochiral precursors into chiral products. Examples. Typical substrates are epoxides, diols, dienes, and carboxylic acid anhydrides. One example is the conversion of cis-3,5-diacetoxycyclopentene to monoacetate. In this transformation, the plane of symmetry in the precursor is lost, and the product is asymmetric. The desymmetrisation itself is not usually considered useful. The \"enantioselective\" desymmetrisation however delivers a useful product. This particular conversion utilizes the enzyme cholinesterase. In another example, a symmetrical cyclic imide is subjected to asymmetric deprotonation resulting in a chiral product with high enantioselectivity. Transfer hydrogenation converts benzil (PhC(O)C(O)Ph) into one enantiomer of hydrobenzoin: PhC(O)C(O)Ph + 2 H2 \u2192 PhCH(OH)CH(OH)Ph The precursor benzil has C2v", "Uphill Battle was an American metalcore band with elements of grindcore, based out of Santa Barbara, California, United States.

HAD CCDs are used in consumer and professional single and three-chip video cameras. Operation. The \"hole\" refers to places in a semiconductor where an electron has been dislodged, thus creating a positive charge. These \"holes\" or positive charges can be created by heat or imperfections in the creation of the imaging chip. The \"holes\" are accumulated, or trapped, in a separate semiconductor layer that acts as a diode that prevents them from returning or creating noise. HAD technology suppresses the fixed pattern noise that results from \"dark\" current that occurs regardless of the amount of absorbed light. By fabricating a hole-accumulation layer below the surface of the CCD, \"dark\" current can be suppressed at the source.", "Adam Lewis Schroeder is a Canadian novelist and short story writer.

One common application of the BAI format is for use by banks to transmit returned item data to customers (for example, checks which have been marked insufficient funds (NSF)). The current release is \"Cash Management Balance Reporting Specifications Version 2\", typically referred to as \"BAI2\". History. In 1971, BAI created a precursor to the BAI format called the \"Lockbox Communications Standards for Banks\", which supported reporting only for lockbox services. This standard was never updated and was eventually superseded by the BAI format. In 1980, BAI, working with various U.S. banks, released \"BAI1\", the \"Cash Management Balance Reporting Specification, Version 1\", the first release of cash management balance reporting specifications. Some banks still use BAI1, but BAI discontinued formal support after 1990. In 1987, the original specifications were replaced by \"BAI2\". In 2001, the \"BAI2\" specifications were updated to include new codes for lending transactions.

According to others the nickname emerged because when all the blockers were in place to protect the ball carrier it would appear, from the point of view of a defender, that the entire USC student body was leading the play. The play was very similar to the Packers sweep utilized by the Green Bay Packers of the 1960s under coach Vince Lombardi. Later years.

Example. Suppose we have the string codice_1, and we are using a compression method that works by putting a special character into the string (say codice_2) followed by a value that points to an entry in a lookup table (or dictionary) of repeating values. Let us imagine we have an algorithm that examines the string in 4 character chunks. Looking at our string, our algorithm might pick out the values 1234 and 9999 to place into its dictionary. Let us say that 1234 is entry 0 and 9999 is entry 1. Now the string can become: @0@1@0@1@0 This string is much shorter, although storing the dictionary itself will", "Santa F\u00e9 do Sul is a municipality in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.

Work on the M6 mine began in 1943, after the campaigns in North Africa. Testing had revealed the smaller M1 mine, filled with of TNT, had difficulties breaking the tracks of heavy tanks such as the Tiger I, and it was desired that in addition to correcting technical defects with the M1, a heavy mine similar to the German Teller mine (with of explosives) be available to American forces. After correction of defects in the T6E1, contracts were issued before the mine was standardized, and it began production in May 1944. The T6E1 was standardized as the M6 in September 1944. Because of a lessening need for antitank mines as the Allies went on the offensive in 1944, the T6E1/M6 was not deployed to the European theater. They were superseded in service after WWII by the larger M15 mine. The mine is normally painted olive green and has a large central pressure plate. In the center of the pressure plate is an arming plug that has an arming lever with three settings: ARMED, DANGER and SAFE. The pressure plate rests on a concertina-like structure, which when enough force is applied is compressed. Compression results in a transfer plate under the arming plug pressing downwards onto a belleville spring which inverts, flipping the firing pin into the detonator, which triggers the adjacent explosive booster and main explosive charge. The mine is fitted with two secondary fuze wells on the side and bottom to enable anti-handling devices to be fitted. The M6 and M6A1 variants were fitted with chemical fuzes, the M600 and M601, the later M6A2 used the mechanical M603 fuze.
